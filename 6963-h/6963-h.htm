<p style="font-weight: bold;">COURSE OF READING</p>
<p>In the ELSON READERS selections are grouped according to theme or
authorship. This arrangement, however, is not intended to fix an order
for reading in class; its purpose is to emphasise classification,
facilitate comparison, and enable pupils to appreciate similarities and
contrasts in the treatment of like themes by different authors.</p>
<p>To give variety, to meet the interests at different seasons and
festivals, and to go from prose to poetry and from long to short
selections, a carefully planned order of reading should be followed.
Such an order of reading calls for a full consideration of all the
factors mentioned above. The Course here offered meets these ends but
may easily be varied to fit local conditions.</p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></big></p>
<p>This book is designed to furnish reading material of choice literary
and dramatic quality. The selections for the most part are those that
have stood the test of time and are acknowledged masterpieces. The
groupings into the separate parts will aid both teachers and pupils in
the classification of the material, indicating at a glance the range and
variety of the literature included.</p>
<p>Part One deals with poetry, and it is believed the poems offered in
this group are unsurpassed. No effort on the teacher's part will be
needed to arouse the enthusiasm of pupils who read the series of famous
rides with which this group opens. The thrill of delight which children
feel as they read of "A hurry of hoofs in a village street," or
"Charging an army while all the world wondered," may lead to the
stronger and more enduring emotions of patriotism and devotion. "John
Gilpin's Ride," which has furnished amusement for generations of old and
young, finds a place here. The rhythmic movement of these poems makes a
natural transition to those selections especially designed as studies in
rhythm. The series of nature poems and selections from Shakespeare
complete a group of choice literary creations. Part Two is given to a
study of the great American authors, and no apology is needed either for
the choice of material or for the prominence given to this group. It is
especially suited to parallel and supplement the work of this grade in
American history. Part Three contains patriotic selections and some of
the great orations. These are lofty and inspiring in style, within the
grasp of the pupils, and are especially helpful in developing power of
expression.</p>
<p>It is not expected that the order of selections will be followed. On
the contrary, each teacher will follow the order which will best suit
her own plans and purposes. While there is much material in the book
that will re-enforce lessons in history, geography, and nature study,
yet it is not for this that these selections should be studied, but
rather for the pleasure that comes from reading beautiful thoughts
beautifully expressed. The reading lesson should therefore be a study of
literature, and it should lead the children to find beauty of thought
and imagery, fitness in figures of speech, and delicate shades of
meaning in words. Literature is an art, and the chief aim of the reading
lesson is to discover and interpret its art qualities. In this way
children learn how to read books and are enabled to appreciate the
literary treasures of the race. The business of the reading book is to
furnish the best available material for this purpose.</p>
<p>It is worth while to make a thorough study of a few well-chosen
selections. Through the power gained in this way children are enabled to
interpret and enjoy other selections without the aid of the teacher. If
the class work is for the most part of the intensive kind, the pupils
will read the remaining lessons alone for sheer pleasure, which is at
once the secret and goal of good teaching in literature. Moreover, they
will exercise a discriminating taste and judgment in their choice of
reading matter. To love good literature, to find pleasure in reading it
and to gain power to choose it with discrimination are the supreme ends
to be attained by the reading lesson. For this reason, some selections
should be read many times for the pleasure they give the children. In
music the teacher sometimes calls for expressions of preference among
songs: "What song shall we sing, children?" So in reading, "What
selection shall we read?" is a good question for the teacher to ask
frequently. Thus children come to make familiar friends of some of the
stories and poems, and find genuine enjoyment in reading these again and
again.</p>
<p>Good results may also be obtained by assigning to a pupil a
particular lesson which he is expected to prepare. On a given day he
will read to the class the selection assigned to him. The orations are
especially suited to this mode of treatment. The pupil who can read one
selection well has gone a long way toward being a good reader. The
teacher who said to her pupils, "I shall read to you tomorrow,"
recognized this truth and knew the value of an occasional exercise of
that kind. Good pedagogy approves of a judicious use of methods of
imitation in teaching reading.</p>
<p>The biographies are intended to acquaint the children with the
personal characteristics and lives of the authors, making them more
interesting and real to the children, giving them the human touch and
incidentally furnishing helpful data for interpreting their writings. In
this connection, the authors have, by permission, drawn freely from
Professor Newcomer's English and American Literatures. "Helps to Study"
include questions and notes designed to stimulate inquiry on the part of
pupils and to suggest fruitful lines of study. Only a few points are
suggested, to indicate the way, and no attempt is made to cover the
ground adequately; this remains for the teacher to do.</p>
<p>While placing emphasis primarily on the thought-getting process the
formalities of thought-giving must not be overlooked. The technique of
reading, though always subordinate and secondary to the mastery of the
thought, nevertheless claims constant and careful attention. Good
reading requires clear enunciation and correct pronunciation and these
can be secured only when the teacher steadily insists upon them. The
increase of foreign elements in our school population and the influence
of these upon clearness and accuracy of speech furnish added reason for
attention to these details. Special drill exercises should be given and
the habit of using the dictionary freely should be firmly established in
pupils. The ready use of the dictionary and other reference books for
pronunciation and meaning of words, for historical and mythical
allusions should be steadily cultivated. Without doubt much of the
reading accepted in the public schools is seriously deficient in these
particulars. The art of good reading can be cultivated by judicious
training and the school should spare no pains to realize this result.</p>
<p>Professor Clark, in his book on "How to Teach Reading," sets forth
the four elements of vocal expression--Time, Pitch, Quality and Force.
We quote a few of the sentences from his treatment of each of these
elementary topics.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">I. TIME.</span> Time, then, refers
to the rate of vocal movement. It may be fast, or moderate, or slow,
according to the amount of what may be called the collateral thinking
accompanying the reading, of any given passage. To put it another way: a
phrase is read slowly because it means much; because the thought is
large, sublime, deep. The collateral thinking may be revealed by an
expansive paraphrase. For instance, in the lines</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his corse to the rampart we hurried,"</p>
<p><i>why</i> do we read slowly? The paraphrase answers the question. It
was midnight. There lay our beloved leader, who should have been borne
in triumphal procession to his last resting place. Bells should have
tolled, cannon thundered, and thousands should have followed his bier.
But now, alas, by night, by stealth, without even a single drum tap, in
fear and dread, we crept breathless to the rampart. This, or any one of
a hundred other paraphrases, will suffice to render the vocal movement
slow. And so it is with all slow time. Let it be remembered that a
profound or sublime thought may be uttered in fast time; but that when
we dwell upon that thought, when we hold it before the mind, the time
must necessarily be slow. If a child read too rapidly, it is because his
mind is not sufficiently occupied with the thought; if he read too
slowly, it is because he does not get the words; or because he is
temperamentally slow; or because, and this is the most likely
explanation, he is making too much of a small idea. To tell him to read
fast or slow is but to make him affected, and, incidentally, even if
unconsciously, to impress upon him that reading is a matter of
mechanics, and not of thought-getting and thought-giving."</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">II. PITCH.</span> By Pitch is meant
everything that has to do with the acuteness or gravity of the tone--in
other words, with keys, melodies, inflections and modulations. When we
say of one that he speaks in a high key, we should be understood as
meaning that his pitch is prevailingly high; and that the reverse is
true when we say of one that he speaks in a low key. While it is true
that the key differs in individuals, yet experience shows that within a
note or two, we all use the same keys in expressing the same states of
minds. The question for us is, what determines the key? It can be set
down as a fixed principle, that controlled mental states are expressed
by low keys, while the high keys are the manifestation of the less
controlled mental conditions. Drills in inflections as such are of very
little value, and potentially very harmful. Most pupils have no
difficulty in making proper inflections, so that for them class drills
are time wasted; for those whose reading is monotonous, because of lack
of melodic variety, the best drills are those which teach them to make a
careful analysis of the sentences, and those which awaken them to the
necessity of impressing the thought upon others. We have learned that
when a pupil has the proper motive in mind and is desirous of conveying
his intention to another, a certain melody will always manifest that
intention. The melody, then, is the criterion of the pupil's purpose.
The moment a pupil loses sight of a phrase and its relation to the other
phrases, that moment his melody betrays him."</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">III. QUALITY.</span> Quality
manifests emotional states. By Quality we mean that subtle element in
the voice by which is expressed at one time tenderness, at another
harshness, at another awe, and so on through the whole gamut of feeling.
The teacher now knows that emotion affects the quality of tone. Let him
then use this knowledge as he has learned to use his knowledge of the
other criteria. We recognize instinctively the qualities that express
sorrow, tenderness, joy, and the other states of feeling. When the
proper quality does not appear it is because the child has no feeling,
or the wrong feeling, generally the former. There is but one way to
correct the expression, i. e., by stimulating the imagination."</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">IV. FORCE.</span> Force manifests
the degree of mental energy. When we speak in a loud voice, there is
much energy; when softly, there is little. Do not tell the child to read
louder. If you do, you will get loudness--that awful grating schoolboy
loudness--without a particle of expression in it. Many a child reads
well, but is bashful. When we tell him to read louder, he braces himself
for the effort and kills the quality, which is the finer breath and
spirit of oral expression, and gives us a purely physical thing--force.
Put your weak-voiced readers on the platform; let them face the class
and talk to you, seated in the middle of the room, and you will get all
the force you need. On the whole, we have too much force, rather than
too little. Let the teacher learn that we want quality, not quantity,
and our statement of the mental action behind force will be of much
benefit in creating the proper conditions."</p>
<p>To discriminating teachers it will be apparent that this book is not
the usual school reader. On the contrary it differs widely from this in
the cultural value of the selections, in the classification and
arrangement of material, in the variety of interest to which it appeals,
and in the abundance of classic literature from American authors which
it contains. It aims to furnish the best in poetry and prose to be found
in the literature of the English-speaking race and to furnish it in
abundance. If these familiar old selections, long accepted as among the
best in literature, shall be the means of cultivating in pupils a taste
for good reading, the book will have fulfilled its purpose.</p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, my
children, and you shall hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a man is now alive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who remembers that famous day and year.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to his
friend: "If the British march<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By land or sea from the town tonight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the North Church tower, as a signal-light,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One if by land, and two if by sea;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I on the opposite shore will be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the country-folk to be up and to arm."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said
"good night," and with muffled oar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the moon rose over the bay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Somerset, British man-of-war:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom ship, with each mast and spar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the moon, like a prison-bar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a huge black hulk, that was magnified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its own reflection in the tide.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, his
friend through alley and street<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders and watches with eager ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in the silence around him he hears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muster of men at the barrack-door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the measured tread of the grenadiers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching down to their boats on the shore.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he climbed
to the tower of the church,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the belfry-chamber overhead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And startled the pigeons from their perch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sombre rafters, that round him made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masses and moving shapes of shade,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the trembling ladder, steep and tall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the highest window in the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he paused to listen and look down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment on the roofs of the town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moonlight flowing over all.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath, in the
churchyard, lay the dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their night-encampment on the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in silence so deep and still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchful night-wind, as it went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping along from tent to tent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment only he feels the spell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the place and the hour, the secret dread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lonely belfry and the dead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For suddenly all his thoughts are bent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a shadowy something far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the river widens to meet the bay,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of black, that bends and floats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile,
impatient to mount and ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he patted his horse's side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now gazed at the landscape far and near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then impetuous stamped the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly he watched with eager search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfry-tower of the old North Church,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it rose above the graves on the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second lamp in the belfry burns!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurry of hoofs
in a village-street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a
spark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all! And yet, through the gloom and
the light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spark struck out by that steed, in his
flight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindled the land into flame with its heat.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has left the
village and mounted the steep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the alders, that skirt its edge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard the tramp of the steed as he rides.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was twelve by
the village-clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the crowing of the cock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barking of the farmer's dog,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the damp of the river-fog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises after the sun goes down.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one by the
village-clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he galloped into Lexington.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gilded weathercock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim in the moonlight as he passed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze at him with a spectral glare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they already stood aghast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bloody work they would look upon.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was two by the
village-clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the bridge in Concord town.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the bleating of the flock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the twitter of birds among the trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the breath of the morning-breeze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing over the meadows brown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was safe and asleep in his bed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at the bridge would be first to fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who that day would be lying dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced by a British musket-ball.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the
rest. In the books you have read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the British regulars fired and fled,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the farmers gave them ball for ball,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing the redcoats down the lane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then crossing the fields to emerge again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the trees at the turn of the road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only pausing to fire and load.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the
night rode Paul Revere;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so through the night went his cry of alarm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every Middlesex village and farm,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry of defiance, and not of fear,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a word that shall echo forevermore!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all our history, to the last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hour of darkness and peril and need,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people will waken and listen to hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the midnight-message of Paul Revere.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of the road and bandit chief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking refuge and relief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the mountain pathway

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erzeroum and Trebizond,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journeying north from Koordistan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave him wealth and

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven hundred and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men at arms his livery wore,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, through regions all unknown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wandering, lost, alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking, without guide,
his way.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the
pathway ends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer the precipice descends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the torrent roars
unseen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty feet from side to side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yawns the chasm; on air must ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who crosses this
ravine.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following close
in his pursuit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the precipice's foot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyhan the Arab of Orfah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halted with his hundred men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting upward from the glen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"La Ill&aacute;h ilia
All&aacute;h!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently Roushan
Beg caressed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrat's forehead, neck and breast;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissed him upon both
his eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang to him in his wild way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As upon the topmost spray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings a bird before it
flies.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; "O my Kyrat, O my steed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound and slender as a reed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carry me this peril
through!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satin housings shall be thine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoes of gold, O Kyrat mine,<br>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyrat, then, the
strong and fleet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew together his four white feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused a moment on the
verge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measured with his eye the space,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into the air's embrace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped as leaps the
ocean surge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ocean

bore;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattling down the deep abyss<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolled like pebbles on
a shore.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roushan's
tasseled cap of red<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembled not upon his head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careless sat he and
upright;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither hand nor bridle shook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor his head he turned to look,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he galloped out of
sight.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash of harness
in the air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen a moment, like the glare<br>

its sheath;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the phantom horseman passed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadow that he cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped the cataract
underneath.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyhan the Arab
held his breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this vision of life and death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed above him.
"Allahu!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried he. "In all Koordistan<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">HELPS TO STUDY.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical And Historical: </span>Alfred
Tennyson was born in that memorable birth year, 1809, which brought
into the world a company of the greatest men of the century, including
Darwin, Gladstone, Lincoln, Poe, Chopin, and Mendelssohn. He was one of
twelve children who lived together a healthful life of study and sport.
Gathering the other children about him he held them captive with his
stories of knightly deeds--tales drawn partly from his reading and
partly from his fertile fancy. They lived again the thrilling life of
joust and tournament. Past the house in the village of Somersby, in
Lincolnshire, where his father was rector, flowed a brook, in all
probability the brook that came "from haunts of coot and hern... to
bicker down a valley." He was a student at Cambridge, where he met and
became deeply attached to Arthur Henry Hallam, whose death not long
afterward inspired the poem "In Memoriam." In 1850, upon Wordsworth's
death, Tennyson was made poet laureate and the poem commemorating the
heroic charge at Balaklava in 1854, "The Charge of the Light Brigade,"
shows how he adorned this office. In 1884 the queen raised him to the
peerage, and from that time he was known as Lord Tennyson. He lived as
much in retirement as was possible, part of the time making his home in
the Isle of Wight. He died in 1892 and was buried in the Poets' Corner
in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>The event which this poem describes occurred at Balaklava in the
Crimea, October 25th, 1854. Of six hundred seven men only about one
hundred fifty survived. The order to charge, bearing the signature of
Lord Lucan, was delivered by Captain Nolan to the Earl of Cardigan, who
was in command of the "Light Brigade." Nolan was killed in the charge
while Cardigan survived. The death of Nolan made it impossible to
determine whether the signature to the order was genuine or forged.</p>
<p>It was in this war that Florence Nightingale rendered such noble
service as hospital nurse. She arrived at Balaklava ten days after this
charge.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning came,
the chaise was brought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet was not allowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive up to the door, lest all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should say that she was
proud.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So three doors
off the chaise was stayed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they did all get
in;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six precious souls, and all agog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dash through thick
and thin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smack went the
whip, 'round went the wheels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were never folks so
glad;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stones did rattle underneath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if Cheapside were
mad.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Gilpin at
his horse's side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized fast the flowing
mane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up he got, in haste to ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon came down
again;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For saddle-tree
scarce reached had he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His journey to begin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, turning round his head, he saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three customers come in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So down he came;
for loss of time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it grieved him
sore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would trouble him much
more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas long before
the customers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were suited to their
mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Betty screaming came down stairs,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wine is left
behind!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good lack!"
quoth he, "yet bring it me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My leathern belt
likewise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which I bear my trusty sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I do exercise."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mrs. Gilpin,
careful soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had two stone bottles
found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the liquor that she loved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep it safe and
sound.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bottle had a
curling ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the belt
he drew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hung a bottle on each side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his balance
true.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, over all,
that he might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipped from top to
toe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His long red cloak, well brushed and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He manfully did throw.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now see him
mounted once again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his nimble steed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full slowly pacing o'er the stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With caution and good
heed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finding soon
a smoother road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his well-shod
feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snorting beast began to trot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which galled him in his
seat.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So "Fair and
softly" John he cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But John he cried in
vain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That trot became a gallop soon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of curb and
rein.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So stooping down,
as needs he must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot sit upright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grasped the mane with both his hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eke with all his
might.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His horse, which
never in that sort<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had handled been before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What thing upon his back had got<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did wonder more and
more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went Gilpin,
neck or nought;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went hat and wig;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He little dreamed when he set out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of running such a rig.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind did
blow, the cloak did fly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like streamer long and
gay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, loop and button failing both,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last it flew away.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then might all
people well discern,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottles he had
slung;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle swinging at each side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath been said or
sung.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dogs did
bark, the children screamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up flew the windows all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every soul cried out, "Well done!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As loud as he could
bawl.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went
Gilpin--who but he?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fame soon spread
around;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He carries weight, he rides a race!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis for a thousand
pound!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, as
fast as he drew near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas wonderful to view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in a trice the turnpike men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their gates wide open
threw.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, as he
went bowing down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reeking head full
low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottles twain behind his back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shattered at a
blow.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down ran the wine
into the road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most piteous to be seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made his horse's flanks to smoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they had basted been.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still he
seemed to carry weight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leathern girdle
braced;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all might see the bottle necks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still dangling at his
waist.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus all through
merry Islington<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gambols he did
play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he came unto the wash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Edmonton so gay;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he
threw the wash about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the
way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like unto a trundling mop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a wild goose at play.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Edmonton his
loving wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the balcony spied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tender husband, wondering much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see how he did ride.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, stop, John
Gilpin! Here's the house!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all at once did
cry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dinner waits and we are tired."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Gilpin, "So am I!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet his horse
was not a whit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclined to tarry there;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For why? his owner had a house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full ten miles off, at
Ware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So like an arrow
swift he flew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot by an archer
strong;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did he fly--which brings me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of my song.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went Gilpin,
out of breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sore against his
will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, at his friend the calender's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His horse at last stood
still.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calender,
amazed to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His neighbor in such
trim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus accosted him:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What news? what
news? your tidings tell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me you must and
shall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say why bareheaded you are come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why you come at all?"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Gilpin had a
pleasant wit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved a timely joke;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus unto the calender,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In merry guise, he
spoke:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came because
your horse would come;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if I well forbode,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hat and wig will soon be here:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are upon the road."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calender,
right glad to find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend in merry pin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned him not a single word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the house went
in;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence straight
he came with hat and wig;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wig that flowed
behind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hat not much the worse for wear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each comely in its kind.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held them up
and in his turn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus showed his ready
wit:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My head is twice as big as yours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, therefore, needs
must fit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me scrape
the dirt away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hangs upon your
face;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stop and eat, for well you may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be in a hungry case."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said John, "It is
my wedding day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world would
stare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If wife should dine at Edmonton<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should dine at
Ware."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, turning to
his horse, he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in haste to dine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas for your pleasure you came here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall go back for
mine."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! luckless
speech and bootless boast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he paid full
dear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For while he spake, a braying ass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did sing most loud and
clear;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat his horse
did snort, as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had heard a lion roar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And galloped off with all his might,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he had done before.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went Gilpin,
and away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went Gilpin's hat and
wig:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost them sooner than at first;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For why?--they were too
big.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mistress
Gilpin, when she saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband posting down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the country far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out half a
crown;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus unto the
youth she said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drove them to the
Bell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shall be yours when you bring back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband safe and
well."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth did
ride, and soon did meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John coming back amain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom in a trice he tried to stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By catching at his rein;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not
performing what he meant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gladly would have
done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frightened steed he frighted more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him faster run.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went Gilpin,
and away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went postboy at his
heels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postboy's horse right glad to miss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lumbering of the
wheels.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six gentlemen
upon the road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus seeing Gilpin fly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With postboy scampering in the rear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised the hue and
cry;--</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop thief! stop
thief! a highwayman!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one of them was
mute;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all and each that passed that way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did join in the pursuit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the
turnpike gates again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew open in short
space;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toll-men thinking as before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Gilpin rode a race.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he did,
and won it too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he got first to
town;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor stopped till where he had got up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did again get down.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us sing
"Long Live the King,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gilpin, long live
he;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he next doth ride abroad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be there to see!<br>

GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ROBERT BROWNING</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sprang to the
stirrup, and Joris, and he;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all
three;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good speed!" cried the watch, as the
gate-bolts undrew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speed!" echoed the wall to us galloping
through;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to
rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into the midnight we galloped abreast.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word to
each other; we kept the great pace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing
our place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique
right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the
bit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas moonset at
starting; but while we drew near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned
clear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At D&uuml;ffeld, 'twas morning as plain as
could be;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the
half-chime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is
time!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Aershot, up
leaped of a sudden the sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And against him the cattle stood black every
one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stare through the mist at us galloping past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze, as some bluff river headland its
spray:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his low head
and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my voice, and the other pricked out on his
track;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one eye's black intelligence,--ever that
glance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er its white edge at me, his own master,
askance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and
anon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Hasselt, Dirck
groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in
her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll remember at Aix"--for one heard the quick
wheeze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and
staggering knees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we were left
galloping, Joris and I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright
stubble like chaff;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till over by Dalhem, a dome-spire sprang white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix is in
sight!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How they'll
greet us!"--and all in a moment his roan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the news which alone could save Aix from her
fate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his nostrils like pits full of blood to
the brim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with circles of red for his eye-sockets'
rim.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I cast loose
my buffcoat, each holster let fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and
all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without
peer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise,
bad or good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and
stood.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all I
remember is--friends flocking round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the
ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no voice but was praising this Roland of
mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I poured down his throat our last measure of
wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was no more than his due who brought good news
from Ghent.<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>
Robert Browning was born in a suburb of London in 1812. His four
grandparents were respectively of English, German, Scotch, and Creole
birth. After his marriage with the poet, Elizabeth Barrett, he lived in
Italy, where in the old palace Casa Guidi, in Florence, they spent years
of rare companionship and happiness. After her death he returned to
England, but spent most of his summers abroad. On the Grand Canal, in
Venice, the gondoliers point out a palace where at his son's home,
Browning died in 1889. He was buried in the Poets' Corner, Westminster
Abbey.</p>
<p>Browning's poems are not easy to read, because he condenses so much
into a word or phrase and he often leaves large gaps to be filled in by
the reader's imagination. Any one can make selections of lines and even
entire poems from Tennyson, Poe, Southey, and Lanier, in which the poet
has created for us verbal music and beauty. Browning, however, is not so
much concerned with this side of poetry as he is with portraying
correctly the varied emotions of the human soul.</p>
<p>"Love in the largest sense, as the divine principle working through
all nature, is at the very center of Browning's creed. His is the
heartiest, happiest, most beautiful poetic voice that his age has read.
He stands apart from most others of his kind and age in the positiveness
of his religious faith, a faith that is based upon a conviction of the
conquering universality of love and self-sacrifice."</p>
<p>"How They Brought the Good News" is without historical basis; the
ride occurred only in the imagination of the poet. The inspiration came
from Browning's longing for a horseback gallop over the English downs.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, we
French stormed Ratisbon:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mile or so away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a little mound, Napoleon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood on our
storming-day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legs wide, arms locked
behind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to balance the prone brow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppressive with its
mind.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as perhaps
he mused, "My plans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That soar, to earth may
fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let once my army-leader, Lannes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waver at yonder wall,"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rider, bound on bound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-galloping; nor bridle drew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he reached the
mound.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then off there
flung in smiling joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held himself erect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By just his horse's mane, a boy:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hardly could
suspect--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(So tight he kept his lips compressed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce any blood came
through)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked twice ere you saw his breast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all but shot in two.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," cried he,
"Emperor, by God's grace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got you Ratisbon!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal's in the market-place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you'll be there anon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your flag-bird flap his vans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I, to heart's
desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soared up again like
fire.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiefs eye
flashed; but presently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softened itself, as
sheathes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A film the mother eagle's eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her bruised eaglet
breathes:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched to the quick,
he said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm killed, sire!" And his chief beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling, the boy fell
dead.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ROBERT BROWNING</small></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sea and
at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the English fight
the French--woe to France!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter
through the blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of
sharks pursue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came crowding ship on
ship to St. Malo on the Rance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the English fleet in view.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas the
squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost of
the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close
on him fled, great and small,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two
good ships in all;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they signalled to the place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help the winners of a race!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get us guidance, give
us harbor, take us quick--or, quicker still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the English can
and will!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the pilots
of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, what hope or
chance have ships like these to pass?" laughed they:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rocks to starboard,
rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall the "Formidable" here, with her twelve
and eighty guns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think to make the
river-mouth by the single narrow way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust to enter--where 'tis ticklish for a craft
of twenty tons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
with flow at full beside?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,
'tis slackest ebb of tide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach the mooring?
Rather say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rock stands or water runs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a ship will leave
the bay!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was called a
council straight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief and bitter the debate:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's the English at our heels; would you
have them take in tow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that's left us of the fleet, linked
together stern and bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a prize to Plymouth Sound? Better run the
ships aground!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ended Damfreville his
speech).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a minute more to wait!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the captains all
and each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shove ashore, then blow
up, burn the vessels on the beach!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France must undergo her fate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give the word!"
But no such word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ever spoke or heard:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For up stood, for out
stepped, for in struck, amid all these,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A captain? a lieutenant? a mate,--first,
second, third?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
such man of mark, and meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
his betters to compete!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
a simple Breton sailor, pressed by Tourville for the fleet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor coasting-pilot,
he,---Herv&eacute; Riel, the Croisickese.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "What mockery
or malice have we here?" cried Herv&eacute; Riel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you mad, you
Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to me of rocks and shoals?--me, who took
the soundings, tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every
swell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the offing here
and Gr&egrave;ve, where the river disembogues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the
lying's for?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morn
and eve, night and day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have
I piloted your bay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of
Solidor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn the fleet, and
ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirs, they know I speak
the truth! Sirs, believe me, there's way!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only let me lead the line,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the biggest ship
to steer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get this <i>Formidable</i>
clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the others follow mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I
know well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Solidor past
Gr&egrave;ve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
there lay them safe and sound;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if one ship
misbehave,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keel
so much as grate the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I've nothing but my life,--here's my
head!" cries Herv&eacute; Riel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a minute more
to wait.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steer us in, then, small and great!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take
the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captains, give the sailor place!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
is Admiral, in brief.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the north-wind, by God's grace!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the noble fellow's face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the big ship, with a bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clears the entry like a hound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps the passage, as its inch of way were the
wide sea's profound!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, safe thro' shoal
and rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they follow in a
flock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that
grates the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a spar that comes
to grief!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peril, see, is past.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are harbored to the last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as Herv&eacute; Riel hollas "Anchor!"
sure as fate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the English come,--too late!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the storm
subsides to calm:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They see the green trees wave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the heights
o'erlooking Gr&egrave;ve.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just our rapture to enhance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
the English rake the bay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnash their teeth and glare askance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
they cannonade away!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the
Rance!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hope succeeds despair on each captain's
countenance!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out burst all with one accord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This
is paradise for hell!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let France, let
France's king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank the man that did
the thing!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a shout, and all one word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herv&eacute;
Riel!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he stepped in front once more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a symptom of
surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the frank blue
Breton eyes,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the same man as before.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said
Damfreville, "My friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must speak out at the end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I find the
speaking hard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise is deeper than the lips;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have saved the king his ships;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must name your own
reward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith, our sun was near eclipse!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand whate'er you will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France remains your debtor still.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask to heart's content, and have! or my name's
not Damfreville."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a beam of
fun outbroke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bearded mouth that spoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the honest heart
laughed through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those frank eyes of
Breton blue:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I needs must say my say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since on board the
duty's done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from Malo Roads to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 'tis ask and have, I may--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the others go
ashore--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come! A good whole holiday!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave to go and see my

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he asked and that

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Louvre, face and flank!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall look long
enough ere you come to Herv&eacute; Riel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for better and for worse, Herv&eacute;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my verse, Herv&eacute; Riel, do thou once

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Notes and Questions.</p>
<p>These stanzas are part of a longer poem called "The Brook."</p>
<p>In this poem Tennyson personifies the brook. Why?</p>
<p>In what lines do the words and the rhythm suggest the sound of the
brook?</p>
<p>Which lines do this most successfully?</p>
<p>Point out words that seem to you especially appropriate in giving
the thought.</p>
<p>Where in the poem do we find a meaning for the following lines:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! of all the songs sung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No songs are so sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the songs with refrains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which repeat and repeat."</p>
<p>How does the repetition of "chatter" influence the melody of the
first line in the sixth stanza?</p>
<p>How does it affect the thought?</p>
<p>Find another place in the poem where an expression is repeated.</p>
<p>Was this done for the sake of the rhythm, or the thought, or for
both?</p>
<p>Alliteration is the repetition of the same letter or sound at the
beginning of two or more words in close succession.</p>
<p>Find lines in which alliteration is used e. g. "sudden sally,"
"field and fallow," etc. What does this add to the poem?</p>
<p>Indicate the rhythm of the first four lines by placing them in these
curves:<br>

South has given us two most melodious singers, Poe and Lanier. When
only nineteen Sidney Lanier enlisted in the Confederate army, and the
close of the war found him broken in health, with little else in the
world than a brave wife and a brave heart. When his health permitted he
played the flute in an orchestra in Baltimore. The rhythm, the rhyme and
the melodious words of his poetry all show him the passionate lover of
music that he was. Among his prose writings, "The Boy's Froissart" and
"The Boy's King Arthur" are of especial interest to young readers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>
Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston on January 19th, 1809. Both his
parents were members of a theatrical troupe then playing in Boston. He
was left an orphan at the age of three years, and was adopted by a
wealthy Virginia planter and by him educated in England and elsewhere.
Owing to his erratic habits, Poe's foster-father disowned him, and after
that life for him was a constant battle with poverty. His prose tales
abound in adventure, allegory, and the supernatural. His poetry is full
of imagery, beauty, and melody.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was many and
many a year ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the name of Annabel
Lee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to love and be
loved by me.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a child and
she was a child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the
sea:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we loved with a love that was more than
love--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I and my Annabel Lee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a love that the wing&egrave;d seraphs of
heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coveted her and me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this was the
reason that, long ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the
sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My beautiful Annabel
Lee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore her away from
me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the
sea.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels, not
half so happy in heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went envying her and
me--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the
sea)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chilling and killing my
Annabel Lee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our love it
was stronger by far than the love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who were older
than we--<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's
banner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by
foes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A craven hung along the battle's edge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought, "Had I a sword of keener steel--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blue blade that the king's son bears,--but
this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt thing--!" he snapt and flung it from his
hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lowering crept away and left the field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,<br>

William Cullen Bryant was born in 1794 in Western Massachusetts. His
education was carried on in the district school. At home he had the use
of an exceptionally fine library, for that period, and he made the most
of its opportunities. In 1816 he secured a license to practice law, and
journeyed on foot to Plainfield, Mass., to look for a place to open an
office. He felt forlorn and desolate, and the world seemed big and cold.
In this mood, while pausing on his way to contemplate the beauty of the
sunset, he saw a solitary bird wing its way along the horizon. He
watched it until it was lost in the distance. Then he pursued his
journey with new courage and on arriving at the place where he was to
stop for the night, he sat down and wrote this beautiful poem of faith
and hope.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>
Percy Bysshe Shelley was born in 1792. He was an English poet who
traveled much in Europe, and found Italy especially to his liking. His
life was short and full of storm and stress, although he never allowed
his personal sufferings to embitter his spirit. While only thirty, on a
pleasure cruise off the coast of Italy, he was drowned.</p>
<p>"To a Skylark" and "The Cloud" are rare poems because of their
wonderful harmony of sound.</p>
<p>The skylark is found in northern Europe. It is noted for its lofty
flights and wonderful song. Note that Shelley, Wordsworth, and James
Hogg have all written poems about the skylark.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes and Questions.</span></p>

<p>In line 95 emphasize the fifth word and explain the stanza.</p>
<p>In line 96 to end, what does Shelley say would be the result if a
poet could feel such joy as the little bird seems to feel?</p>
<p>If we had no dark days do you think we could appreciate the bright
days?</p>
<p>If we had no sadness could we appreciate the songs of gladness?</p>
<p>If Shelley had never experienced sadness could he have written this
beautiful poem of gladness?</p>
<p><br>
Explain the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no music in the life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds with empty
laughter wholly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's not a string
attuned to mirth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But has its chord in
melancholy."</p>
<p><br>
What does the skylark mean to Shelley?</p>
<p>If we think only of being happy shall we be very helpful to others?</p>
<p>Make a list of all the names he gives the skylark.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring fresh
showers for the thirsting flowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the seas and the streams;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bear light shade for the leaves when laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
their noon-day dreams;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my wings are shaken the dews that waken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sweet buds every one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
she dances about the sun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wield the flail of the lashing hail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
whiten the green plains under;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again I dissolve it in rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
laugh as I pass in thunder.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sift the snow
on the mountains below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
their great pines groan aghast;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the night 'tis my pillow white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I sleep in the
arms of the blast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning, my pilot,
sits;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It struggles and howls
by fits;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pilot is guiding
me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lured by the love of the genii that move<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the
purple sea;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the lakes and the
plains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit he loves
remains;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, all the while, bask in heaven's blue
smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst he is dissolving
in rains.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanguine
sunrise, with his meteor eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his burning plumes
outspread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning-star
shines dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the jag of a mountain-crag,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which an earthquake
rocks and swings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eagle, alit, one moment may sit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of its
golden wings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea
beneath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ardors of rest and
love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crimson pall of eve may fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depth of
heaven above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wings folded I rest, on mine airy nest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As still as a brooding
dove.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That orb&egrave;d
Maiden, with white fire laden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom mortals call the
Moon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the midnight breezes
strewn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which only the angels
hear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars peep behind
her, and peer!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a swarm of golden
bees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the calm rivers,
lakes, and seas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like strips of the sky fallen through me on
high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are each paved with the
moon and these.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bind the sun's
throne with a burning zone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon's with a
girdle of pearl;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and
swim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whirlwinds my
banner unfurl.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a torrent of sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun-beam proof, I hang like a roof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains its
columns be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triumphal arch through which I march<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hurricane, fire,
and snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the powers of the air are chained to my
chair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the million-colored
bow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sphere-fire above its soft colors wove,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the moist earth
was laughing below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the daughter
of earth and water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the nursling of the
sky;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass through the pores of the ocean and
shores;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I change, but I can not
die.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For after the rain, when, with never a stain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pavilion of heaven
is bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the winds and sunbeams, with their convex
gleams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build up the blue dome
of air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of the caverns
of rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sprite from the gloom, like a ghost from
the tomb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise and unbuild it
again.<br>

is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rapture on
the lonely shore,<br>

none intrudes,<br>

music in its roar;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love not man the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man marks the earth

upon the watery plain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrecks are all thy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow of man's

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, for a moment,
like a drop of rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sinks into thy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and
unknown.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not a spoil for

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shake him from
thee; the vile strength he wields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For earth's destruction
thou dost all despise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurning him from thy
bosom to the skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And send'st him,
shivering in thy playful spray,<br>

gods, where haply lies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His petty hope in some

George Gordon Byron was born in London the year before the outbreak of
the French Revolution. At the age of ten, upon the death of his
grand-uncle he became Lord Byron. He traveled extensively through
Europe, spending much time in Italy. At Pisa he formed a warm friendship
for the poet Shelley. So deeply was he moved by his impulses toward
liberty and freedom that in the summer of 1823 he left Genoa with a
supply of arms, medicines, and money to aid the Greeks in their struggle
for independence. In the following year he became commander-in-chief at
Missolonghi, but he died of a fever before he had an opportunity to
actually engage in battle. Hearing the news, the boy Tennyson, dreaming
at Somersby on poetic greatness, crept away to weep and carve upon
sandstone the words, "Byron is dead."</p>

"The Invincible Armada"--an immense Spanish fleet consisting of one
hundred thirty vessels, sailed from Corunna in 1588 and attacked the
English fleet but suffered defeat. This event furnished Southey the
inspiration for a poem, "The Spanish Armada."</p>
<p>"Trafalgar"--one of Lord Nelson's great sea-fights, occurring off
Cape Trafalgar on the coast of Spain in 1805. Here he defeated the
combined fleets of France and Spain, but was himself killed.</p>

with Death's prophetic ear;<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> On the evening of
June 15, 1815, the Duchess of Richmond gave a ball at Brussels.
Wellington's officers, at his request, were present, his purpose being
to conceal the near approach of battle. Napoleon, the leader of the
French army, was the military genius of the age; Wellington, the leader
of the English forces, had, Tennyson tells us, "gained a hundred fights
nor ever lost an English gun." These two great generals now met for the
first time. The event was of supreme interest to all the world. The
engagement that followed next day was fought at Quatre Bras; the great
battle of Waterloo took place June 18th, Sunday. Read Thackeray's
"Vanity Fair" for description of this night in Brussels. This is a great
martial poem--the greatest inspired by this event.</p>
<p>Note the movement of the poem. The revelry, the beauty and the
chivalry, the music and the merry-making, the alarm, the hurrying to and
fro, the gathering tears, the mounting in hot haste, the whispering with
white lips, the Scotch music, the green leaves of Ardennes, the closing
scene.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, in
his guarded tent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Turk was dreaming
of the hour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should tremble at his
power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dreams, through camp and court he bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trophies of a conqueror;<br>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes in heart and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On old Plat&aelig;a's
day:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With arms to strike, and soul to dare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As quick, as far as
they.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour passed
on--the Turk awoke;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bright dream was
his last:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke--to hear his sentries shriek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke--to die mid flames and smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shout and groan, and sabre-stroke,<br>

thick and fast<br>

<p>Charles Wolfe, a British clergyman, was born at Dublin, December 14,
1791, and died at Cork, February 21, 1823. His poem, "The Burial of Sir
John Moore," is the only one of his works now widely read.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> Sir John Moore,
an English general, was killed (January 16, 1809) in an engagement
between the English and the army of Napoleon at Corunna, in Spain. In
accordance with an expressed wish, he was buried at night on the
battlefield. In St. Paul's Cathedral, London, a monument was erected to
his memory, and a stone also marks the spot where he was buried on the
ramparts, at Corunna. Note that it was from this port that the Spanish
Armada sailed.</p>

waters slept. Night's silvery veil hung low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Jordan's bosom, and the eddies curled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their glassy rings beneath it, like the still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbroken beating of the sleeper's pulse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reeds bent down the stream; the willow
leaves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a soft cheek upon the lulling tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot the lifting winds; and the long stems,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose flowers the water, like a gentle nurse,<br>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King
David's limbs were weary. He had fled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From far Jerusalem; and now he stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his faint people, for a little rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the shore of Jordan. The light wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its refreshing breath; for he had worn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mourner's covering, and he had not felt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could see his people until now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gathered round him on the fresh green bank,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoke their kindly words; and as the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose up in heaven, he knelt among them there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bowed his head upon his hands to pray.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when the heart is full--when bitter thoughts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come crowding thickly up for utterance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor, common words of courtesy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are such an empty mockery--how much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed for Israel; and his voice went up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly and fervently. He prayed for those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose love had been his shield; and his deep
tones.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew tremulous. But oh! for Absalom--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his estranged, misguided Absalom--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proud, bright being who had burst away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his princely beauty, to defy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart that cherished him--for him he poured,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In agony that would not be controlled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong supplication, and forgave him there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his God, for his deep sinfulness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pall was settled.
He who slept beneath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was straightened for the grave; and as the folds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunk to the still proportions, they betrayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matchless symmetry of Absalom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair was yet unshorn, and silken curls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were floating round the tassels as they swayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the admitted air, as glossy now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, in hours of gentle dalliance, bathing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snowy fingers of Judea's daughters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His helm was at his feet; his banner, soiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With trailing through Jerusalem, was laid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversed, beside him; and the jeweled hilt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose diamonds lit the passage of his blade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rested, like mockery, on his covered brow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the king trod to and fro,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in the garb of battle; and their chief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty Joab, stood beside the bier,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he feared the slumberer might stir.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slow step startled him. He grasped his blade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a trumpet rang; but the bent form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of David entered, and he gave command,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a low tone, to his few followers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him with his dead. The King stood still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the last echo died; then, throwing off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pall from the still features of his child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head upon him, and broke forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the resistless eloquence of woe:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, my noble
boy, that thou shouldst die!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave his stillness
in this clustering hair!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proud boy, Absalom?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold is thy
brow, my son, and I am chill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to my bosom I have

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a rich
harp-string, yearning to caress thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear thy sweet '<i>My father!</i>' from
these dumb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cold lips, Absalom!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But death is on
thee. I shall hear the gush<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of music, and the
voices of the young;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life will pass me in the mantling blush,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dark tresses to
the soft winds flung--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt
come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet me, Absalom!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And oh! when I
am stricken, and my heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a bruised reed, is
waiting to be broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will its love for thee, as I depart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yearn for thine ear to
drink its last deep token!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see thee, Absalom!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now,
farewell! 'Tis hard to give thee up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With death so like a
gentle slumber on thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy dark sin! Oh, I could drink the cup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If from this woe its
bitterness had won thee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lost boy, Absalom!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He covered up his
face, and bowed himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment on his child; then, giving him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look of melting tenderness, he clasped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands convulsively, as if in prayer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as if strength were given him of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose up calmly, and composed the pall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly and decently, and left him there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his rest had been a breathing sleep.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, young
Lochinvar is come out of the West,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the wide Border his steed was the
best;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, save his good broadsword, he weapons had
none,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rode all unarmed and he rode all alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed not for
brake, and he stopped not for stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swam the Esk river, where ford there was
none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride had consented, the gallant came late:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So boldly he
entered the Netherby hall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and
all:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his
sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For the poor, craven bridegroom said never a
word),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord
Lochinvar?"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I long wooed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by
far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would gladly be bride to the young
Lochinvar!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride kissed
the goblet; the knight took it up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the
cup.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down to blush, and she looked up to
sigh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took her soft hand, ere her mother could
bar,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So stately his
form, and so lovely her face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never a hall such a galliard did grace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her mother did fret, and her father did
fume,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet
and plume,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bridemaidens whispered, "'Twere better,
by far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have matched our fair cousin with young
Lochinvar."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One touch to her
hand, and one word in her ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they reached the hall-door, and the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So light to the saddle before her he sprung!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and
scaur;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth
young Lochinvar.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>
Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, in 1771. He loved the romance of
Scotland's history and legends. A collection of legendary ballads,
songs, and traditions, published by him early in life met with such
immediate success that it confirmed him in his resolution to devote
himself to literary pursuits. The two selections here given, are taken
from his second metrical romance, "Marmion." Later Scott turned his
attention to prose and became the creator of the historical novel, of
which "Ivanhoe," "Kenilworth," and "Woodstock" are conspicuous examples.
He died in 1832, and lies buried in one of the most beautiful ruins in
Scotland, Dryburgh Abbey.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far
advanced was morning day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Marmion did his troop array,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Surrey's camp to
ride;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had safe conduct for his band,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the royal seal and hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas gave a
guide.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train from
out the castle drew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Marmion stopped to bid adieu:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though something I might 'plain," he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of cold respect to
stranger guest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent hither by your
king's behest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Tantallon's towers I staid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part we in friendship
from your land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, noble Earl,
receive my hand."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Douglas round him drew his cloak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My manors, halls, and bowers shall still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be open, at my sovereign's will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To each one whom he
lists, howe'er<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My castles are my king's alone,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Douglas is his own;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never shall, in
friendly grasp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of such as
Marmion clasp."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned Marmion's
swarthy cheek like fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook his very frame for ire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "This to me," he
said;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An 'twere not for thy hoary beard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such hand as Marmion's had not spared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cleave the Douglas'
head!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, first, I tell thee, haughty peer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, who does England's message here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the meanest in her state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May well, proud Angus, be thy mate:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Douglas, more, I tell thee here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in thy pitch of
pride--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell thee, thou'rt
defied!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if thou said'st, I am not peer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any lord in Scotland here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowland or Highland, far or near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Angus, thou hast
lied!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Earl's
cheek, the flush of rage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ercame the ashen hue of age:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce he broke forth; "And dar'st thou then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To beard the lion in his den,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglas in his hall?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hopest thou hence unscathed to go?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up draw-bridge, grooms,--what, warder, ho!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the portcullis
fall."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion turned,--well was his need,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dashed the rowels in his steed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like arrow through the archway sprung;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ponderous grate behind him rung:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass there was such scanty room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bars, descending, razed his plume.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steed along
the draw-bridge flies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as it trembled on the rise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor lighter does the swallow skim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the smooth lake's level brim;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Lord Marmion reached his band<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He halts, and turns with clinched hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shout of loud defiance pours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook his gauntlet at the towers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horse! horse!" the Douglas cried, "and chase!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon he reined his fury's pace:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A royal messenger he came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though most unworthy of the name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Mary mend my fiery mood!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old age ne'er cools the Douglas' blood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought to slay him where he stood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis pity of him, too," he cried;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold he can speak, and fairly ride--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warrant him a warrior tried."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this his mandate he recalls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly seeks his castle halls.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">HELPS TO STUDY.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> Marmion, an
English nobleman, is sent as an envoy by Henry the Eighth, King of
England, to James the Fourth, King of Scotland. The two countries are on
the eve of war with each other. Arriving in Edinburgh, Marmion is
entrusted by King James to the care and hospitality of Douglas, Earl of
Angus, who, taking him to his castle at Tantallon, treats him with the
respect due his position as representative of the king, but at the same
time dislikes him. The war approaching, Marmion leaves to join the
English camp. This sketch describes the leave-taking.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes and Questions.</span></p>
<p>In what part of the castle does this conversation take place? What
tells you?</p>
<p>Where are Marmion's followers during this time? Where are Douglas's
soldiery and servants? What lines tell you?</p>
<p>Notice how simply Marmion reminds Douglas of the claim he had upon
hospitality, while in Scotland. Lines 9 to 12.</p>
<p>Note the claims that have always been allowed the stranger: "And
stranger is a holy name, Guidance and rest and food and fire, In vain he
never must require."</p>
<p>What part of Marmion's claim does Douglas recognize? Which lines
show this?</p>
<p>What claim does Marmion make for one "who does England's message"?</p>
<p>What do we call one "who do England's message" at Washington?</p>
<p>Is this Marmion's personal pride or pride of country (patriotism)?
Read the lines in which Marmion's personal pride shows itself in
resentment of Douglas's insults.</p>
<p>What does Douglas forget when he threatens Marmion? Line 69.</p>
<p>Which man appears to greater advantage in this scene?</p>
<p>"train"--procession.</p>
<p>"'plain"--complain.</p>
<p>"Tantal'lon"--Douglas's castle.</p>
<p>"warder"--guard.</p>

William Shakespeare, the greatest of English poets, indeed one of the
greatest of the world's poets, was born in 1564 at Stratford-on-Avon. As
a young man of twenty-two, after his marriage with Anne Hathaway, he
went up to London, where he became connected with theaters, first,
tradition says, by holding horses at the doors. The next twenty years he
spent in London as an actor, and in writing poems and plays, later
becoming a shareholder as well as an actor. The last ten years of his
life were spent at Stratford, where he died at the age of fifty-two.
This was the time of Queen Elizabeth and is known as the Elizabethan
Age. It was the age richest in genius of all kinds, but especially in
the creation of dramatic literature.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
the world's a stage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the men and women merely players:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made to his mistress' eye-brow. Then a soldier,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the
pard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the
Justice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fair round belly with good capon lined,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sans teeth, sans eyes,

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>OTHELLO. ACT II. SCENE III.</small></p>
<p><br>
<i>Iago</i>. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
<p><i>Cassio</i>. Ay, past all surgery.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my
reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is
bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some
bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation
is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost
without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute
yourself such a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general
again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy
than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to
affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he's yours.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good
a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.
Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou
hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. What was he that you followed with your sword? What had
he done to you?</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I know not.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. Is't possible?</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in
their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy,
pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered?</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to
the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly
despise myself.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time, the
place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish
this had not befallen; but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own
good.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am
a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop
them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient
is a devil.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if
it be well used: exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I
think you think I love you.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I'll
tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: I may
say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to
the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess
yourself freely to her: importune her help to put you in your place
again: she is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she
holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested:
this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter;
and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love
shall grow stronger than it was before.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. You advise me well.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me: I am desperate of my
fortunes if they check me here.</p>
<p><i>Iago</i>. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I must to
the watch.</p>
<p><i>Cas</i>. Good night, honest Iago.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="WASHINGTON_IRVING"></a>WASHINGTON
IRVING</p>
<p>"Washington's work is ended and the child shall be named after him,"
so said the mother of Washington Irving at his birth in New York, April
3, 1783. When, six years later, all New York was enthusiastically
greeting the first President of the United States, a Scotch servant in
the Irving family followed the President into a shop with the youngest
son of the family and approaching him said, "Please, your honor, here's
a bairn was named for you." Washington, putting his hand upon the boy's
head, gave him his blessing. It seems eminently fitting that this boy,
who became known as the Father of American Letters, should write the
biography of the man whose name he bore, and whom we know as the Father
of his Country.</p>
<p>New York was then the capital of the country, a city of about
twenty-five thousand inhabitants, small enough so that it was an easy
matter for the city boy to get into the country. New York itself
retained many traces of its Dutch origin, and upon its streets could be
seen men from all parts of the world. Here the boy grew up happy, seeing
many sides of American life, both in the city and in the country. He was
fun-loving and social, and could hardly be called a student. He greatly
preferred "Robinson Crusoe" and "Sinbad" to the construing of Latin.
Best of all, he liked to go exploring down to the water front to see the
tall ships setting sail for the other side of the world, or, as he grew
older, up the Hudson and into the Catskills, or to that very Sleepy
Hollow which lives for us now because of him. Irving liked people, and
had many warm friends.</p>
<p>These three tastes--for people, for books, and for travel--his life
was destined to gratify. His health being delicate, he was sent abroad
at twenty-one, and the captain of the ship he sailed in, noting his
fragile appearance, said, "There's one who'll go overboard before we get
across," but he happily proved a mistaken prophet. Irving not only
survived the voyage, but spent two years traveling in Italy, France,
Sicily, and the Netherlands. The romantic spirit strong within him
eagerly absorbed medi&aelig;val history and tradition. "My native
country was full of youthful promise; Europe was rich in the accumulated
treasures of age."</p>
<p>Upon his return home, Irving was admitted to the bar, but he never
seriously turned his attention to law. In 1809 he published "A History
of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker." It was a humorous history of New
Amsterdam, a delicious mingling of sense and nonsense, over which Walter
Scott said his "sides were absolutely sore with laughing." While writing
this history a great sorrow touched his life--the death of a young girl
to whom he was deeply attached.</p>
<p>Ten years later, upon his second visit to Europe, Irving published
"The Sketch Book." It rapidly won favor both in England and America.
Byron said of it: "I know it by heart; at least there is not a passage
that I cannot refer to immediately." This second visit to Europe was to
be a short business trip, but as it chanced, it lasted seventeen years.
The first five years were spent in England. Later he went to Spain, and
as a result of this visit, we have a series of books dealing with
Spanish history and tradition--"The Alhambra," "The Conquest of Granada"
and "The Life of Columbus." During all these years and in all these
places, he met and won the regard of hosts of interesting people.
Everyone praised his books, and everyone liked the likable American,
with his distinguished face and gentle manners.</p>
<p>In 1832 Irving was gladly welcomed back to America, for many had
feared that his long absence might mean permanent residence abroad. The
next ten years were spent in his beautiful home, Sunnyside, at
Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, could find
no person more gratifying to the Spanish people, than the author of the
"Life of Columbus" and, in 1842, persuaded Irving to represent us at the
Spanish court. After four years, he returned to America and passed his
time almost exclusively in writing. The work which he finished just
before his death, in November, 1859, was the "Life of Washington." He
was buried on a hill overlooking the river and a portion of the Sleepy
Hollow Valley.</p>
<p>Because of the ease and smoothness of his style, and his delicate
sense of form, Irving delighted his own and succeeding generations of
both his countrymen and his British cousins. All his work is pervaded by
the strong and winning personal quality that brought him the love and
admiration of all. Charles Dudley Warner says of him: "The author loved
good women and little children and a pure life; he had faith in his
fellow-men, a kindly sympathy with the lowest, without any subservience
to the highest. His books are wholesome, full of sweetness and charm, of
humor without any sting, of amusement without any stain; and their more
solid qualities are marred by neither pedantry nor pretension."</p>

<p>The following tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich
Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New York, who was very curious in the
Dutch history of the province, and the manners of the descendants from
its primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie
so much among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty
on his favorite topics; whereas he found the old burghers, and still
more their wives, rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true
history. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family,
snugly shut up in its low-roofed farmhouse under a spreading sycamore,
he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter, and
studied it with the zeal of a book worm. The result of all these
researches was a history of the province during the reign of the Dutch
governors, which he published some years since. There have been various
opinions as to the literary character of his work, and, to tell the
truth, it is not a whit better than it should be. Its chief merit is its
scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little questioned on its first
appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is now
admitted into all historical collections, as a book of unquestionable
authority.</p>
<p>The old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work,
and now that he is dead and gone, it cannot do much harm to his memory
to say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier
labors. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby his own way; and though
it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his
neighbors, and grieve the spirit of some friends, for whom he felt the
truest deference and affection; yet his errors and follies are
remembered "more in sorrow than in anger," and it begins to be suspected
that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his memory may
be appreciated by critics, it is still held dear by many folk, whose
good opinion is worth having; particularly by certain biscuit-bakers,
who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their new-year cakes;
and have thus given him a chance for immortality, almost equal to the
being stamped on a Waterloo Medal, or a Queen Anne's Farthing.</p>
<p>Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill
Mountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian
family, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a
noble height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change
of season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day,
produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains,
and they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect
barometers. When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in
blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky;
but sometimes when the rest of the landscape is cloudless they will
gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last
rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.</p>
<p>At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried
the light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle-roofs gleam
among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into
the fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great
antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists in the
early time of the province, just about the beginning of the government
of the good Peter Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!), and there were
some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years,
built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland, having latticed
windows and gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.</p>
<p>In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to
tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there
lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great
Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle.
He was a descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the
chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of
Fort Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial
character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple,
good-natured man; he was, moreover, a kind neighbor, and an obedient
henpecked husband. Indeed, to the latter circumstance might be owing
that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity; for
those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who are
under the discipline of shrews at home. Their tempers, doubtless, are
rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic
tribulation; and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in the world
for teaching the virtues of patience and long-suffering. A termagant
wife may, therefore, in some respects be considered a tolerable
blessing, and if so, rip Van Winkle was thrice blessed.</p>
<p>Certain it is, that he was a great favorite among all the good wives
of the village, who, as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all
family squabbles; and never failed, whenever they talked those matters
over in their evening gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van
Winkle. The children of the village, too, would shout with joy whenever
he approached. He assisted at their sports, made their playthings,
taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories
of ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the
village, he was surrounded by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts,
clambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with
impunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The great error in Rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to
all kinds of profitable labor. It could not be from the want of
assiduity or perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as
long and heavy as a Tartar's lance, and fish all day without a murmur,
even though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would
carry a fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours together, trudging
through woods and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few
squirrels or wild pigeons. He would never refuse to assist a neighbor,
even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at all country frolics
for husking Indian corn, or building stone-fences; the women of the
village, too, used to employ him to run their errands, and to do such
little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them.
In a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own;
but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it
impossible.</p>
<p>In fact, he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was
the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country;
everything about it went wrong, and would go wrong, in spite of him. His
fences were continually falling to pieces; his cow would either go
astray or get among the cabbages; weeds were sure to grow quicker in his
fields than anywhere else; the rain always made a point of setting in
just as he had some out-door work to do; so that though his patrimonial
estate had dwindled away under his management, acre by acre, until there
was little more left than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet
it was the worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to
nobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised to
inherit the habits, with the old clothes of his father. He was generally
seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels, equipped in a pair of
father's cast-off galligaskins, which he had much ado to hold up with,
one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.</p>
<p>Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish,
well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or
brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would
rather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he
would have whistled life away in perfect contentment; but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness,
and the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning, noon, and night her
tongue was incessantly going, and everything he said or did was sure to
produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way of
replying to all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use, had
grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast up
his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a fresh
volley from his wife; so that he was fain to draw off his forces, and
take to the outside of the house--the only side which, in truth, belongs
to a henpecked husband.</p>
<p>Rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much
henpecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions
in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of
his master's going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit
befitting an honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever
scoured the woods--but what courage can withstand the ever-during and
all-besetting terrors of a woman's tongue? The moment Wolf entered the
house his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground, or curled between
his legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong
glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or
ladle he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.</p>
<p>Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony
rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is
the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long
while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting
a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle
personages of the village; which held its sessions on a bench before a
small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of His Majesty George the
Third. Here they used to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer's
day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy
stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's
money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place,
when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing
traveler. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out
by Derrick Van Bummel, the school-master, a dapper learned little man,
who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary;
and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some months
after they had taken place.</p>
<p>The opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas
Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door
of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving
sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree; so
that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as
by a sun-dial. It is true he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his
pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has his
adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his
opinions. When anything that was read or related displeased him, he was
observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to send forth short, frequent
and angry puffs; but when pleased, he would inhale the smoke slowly and
tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid clouds; and sometimes,
taking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the fragrant vapor curl
about his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of perfect
approbation.</p>
<p>From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by
his termagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of
the assemblage and call the members all to naught; nor was that august
personage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of
this terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her
husband in habits of idleness.</p>
<p>Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only
alternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and clamor of his
wife, was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods. Here he
would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the
contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized, as a
fellow-sufferer in persecution. "Poor Wolf," he would say, "thy mistress
leads thee a dog's life of it; but never mind, my lad, whilst I live
thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee!" Wolf would wag his
tail, look wistfully in his master's face, and if dogs can feel pity I
verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.</p>
<p>In a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day, Rip had
unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill
Mountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel shooting, and the
still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun.
Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a
green knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a
precipice. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the
lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the
lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic
course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging
bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing
itself in the blue highlands.</p>
<p>On the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild,
lonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending
cliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun.
For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually
advancing; the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the
valleys; he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the
village, and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the
terrors of Dame Van Winkle.</p>
<p>As he was about to descend, he heard a voice from a distance,
hallooing, "Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!" He looked round, but could
see nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain.
He thought his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again to
descend, when he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air:
"Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!"--at the same time Wolf bristled up his
back, and giving a low growl, skulked to his master's side, looking
fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing
over him; he looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a
strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight
of something he carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human
being in this lonely and unfrequented place; but supposing it to be some
one of the neighborhood in need of assistance, he hastened down to yield
it.</p>
<p>On nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of
the stranger's appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with
thick bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique
Dutch fashion: a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist, several pair of
breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons
down the sides, and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulder a
stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to
approach and assist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful
of this new acquaintance, Rip complied with his usual alacrity; and
mutually relieving one another, they clambered up a narrow gully,
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended, Rip
every now and then heard long rolling peals like distant thunder, that
seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft, between lofty
rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for a moment,
but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient
thunder-showers which often take place in mountain heights, he
proceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a
small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the
brinks of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only
caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud. During
the whole time Rip and his companion had labored on in silence; for
though the former marveled greatly what could be the object of carrying
a keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something strange
and incomprehensible about the unknown, that inspired awe and checked
familiarity.</p>
<p>On entering the amphitheatre, new objects of wonder presented
themselves. On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking
personages playing at ninepins. They were dressed in a quaint outlandish
fashion; some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in
their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches of similar style
with that of the guide's. Their visages, too, were peculiar; one had a
large beard, broad face, and small piggish eyes; the face of another
seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white
sugar-loaf hat, set off with a little red cock's tail. They all had
beards, of various shapes and colors. There was one who seemed to be the
commander. He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten
countenance; he wore a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger,
high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and high-heeled shoes, with
roses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of the figures in an old
Flemish painting in the parlor of Dominie Van Shaick, the village
parson, which had been brought over from Holland at the time of the
settlement.</p>
<p>What seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that though these folks
were evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest
faces, the most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most
melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted
the stillness of the scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever
they were rolled, echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of
thunder.</p>
<p>As Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted
from their play, and stared at him with such fixed, statue-like gaze,
and such strange, uncouth, lack-lustre countenances, that his heart
turned within him, and his knees smote together. His companion now
emptied the contents of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to
him to wait upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they
quaffed the liquor in profound silence, and then returned to their game.</p>
<p>By degrees Rip's awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured,
when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found
had much of the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty
soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked
another; and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often that at
length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head
gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>On waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first
seen the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes--it was a bright, sunny
morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and the
eagle was wheeling aloft, and breasting the pure mountain breeze.
"Surely," thought Rip, "I have not slept here all night." He recalled
the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with a keg of
liquor--the mountain ravine--the wild retreat among the rocks--the
woe-begone party at ninepins--the flagon--"Oh! that flagon! that wicked
flagon!" thought Rip--"what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?"</p>
<p>He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean, well-oiled
fowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel
incrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He
now suspected that the grave roisterers of the mountain had put a trick
upon him, and, having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun.
Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a
squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him, and shouted his name, but
all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was
to be seen.</p>
<p>He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol, and
if he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose
to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual
activity. "These mountain beds do not agree with me," thought Rip, "and
if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall
have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle." With some difficulty he got
down into the glen; he found the gully up which he and his companion had
ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain
stream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling
the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up
its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch,
sassafras, and witchhazel, and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the
wild grapevines that twisted their coils or tendrils from tree to tree,
and spread a kind of network in his path.</p>
<p>At length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the
cliffs to the amphitheatre; but no traces of such opening remained. The
rocks presented a high, impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came
tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad, deep basin,
black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then, poor Rip
was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog; he
was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high
in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure
in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff at the poor man's
perplexities. What was to be done? the morning was passing away, and Rip
felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up his dog
and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve
among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty fire-lock,
and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps homeward.</p>
<p>As he approached the village he met a number of people, but none
whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself
acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of
a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all
stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast their
eyes upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence
of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his
astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!</p>
<p>He had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange
children ran at his heels, hooting after him, and pointing at his gray
beard. The dogs, too, not one of which he recognized for an old
acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered;
it was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he had
never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had
disappeared. Strange names were over the doors--strange faces at the
windows,--everything was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began to
doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched.
Surely this was his native village, which he had left but the day
before. There stood the Kaatskill Mountains--there ran the silver Hudson
at a distance--there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always
been--Rip was sorely perplexed--"That flagon last night," thought he,
"has addled my poor head sadly!"</p>
<p>It was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house,
which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the
shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay--the
roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A
half-starved dog that looked like Wolf was skulking about it. Rip called
him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. This
was an unkind cut indeed--"My very dog," sighed poor Rip, "has forgotten
me!"</p>
<p>He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had
always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and apparently
abandoned. This desolateness overcame all his connubial fears--he called
loudly for his wife and children--the lonely chambers rang for a moment
with his voice, and then again all was silence.</p>
<p>He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village
inn--but it, too, was gone. A large, rickety wooden building stood in
its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken and mended
with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, "The Union
Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle." Instead of the great tree that used to
shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall
naked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red night-cap,
and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage of
stars and stripes--all this was strange and incomprehensible. He
recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George, under
which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe; but even this was
singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and
buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre, the head was
decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large
characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none that
Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There
was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the
accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the
sage Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double chin, and fair long
pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco-smoke instead of idle speeches; or Van
Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient
newspaper. In place of these, a lean bilious-looking fellow, with his
pockets full of hand bills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of
citizens--elections--members of congress--liberty--Bunker's Hill--heroes
of seventy-six--and other words, which were a perfect Babylonish jargon
to the bewildered Van Winkle.</p>
<p>The appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled heard, his rusty
fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at
his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern-politicians. They
crowded round him, eying him from head to foot with great curiosity. The
orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired "on
which side he voted?" Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but
busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe,
inquired in his ear, "Whether he was Federal or Democrat?" Rip was
equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,
self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way
through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as
he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo,
the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating,
as it were, into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone, "what
brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his
heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?"--"Alas!
gentlemen," cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, "I am a poor quiet man, a
native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!"</p>
<p>Here a general shout burst from the bystanders--"A tory! a tory! a
spy! a refugee! hustle him! away with him!" It was with great difficulty
that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and,
having assumed a tenfold austerity of brow, demanded again of the
unknown culprit what he came there for, and whom he was seeking? The
poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came there
in search of some of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.</p>
<p>"Well--who are they?--name them."</p>
<p>Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, "Where's Nicholas
Vedder?"</p>
<p>There was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in
a thin, piping voice: "Nicholas Vedder! why, he is dead and gone these
eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used
to tell all about him, but that's rotten and gone too."</p>
<p>"Where's Brom Dutcher?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say
he was killed at the storming of Stony Point--others say he was drowned
in a squall at the foot of Antony's Nose. I don't know--he never came
back again."</p>
<p>"Where's Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?"</p>
<p>"He went off to the wars too, was a great militia general, and is
now in Congress."</p>
<p>Rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home
and friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer
puzzled him too, by treating of such enormous lapses of time, and of
matters which he could not understand: war--Congress--Stony Point; he
had no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair,
"Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!" exclaimed two or three, "Oh, to be sure!
that's Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree."</p>
<p>Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he went
up the mountain: apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor
fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and
whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment,
the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name?</p>
<p>"God knows," exclaimed he, at his wit's end; "I'm not myself--I'm
somebody else--that's me yonder--no--that's somebody else got into my
shoes--I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and
they've changed my gun, and everything's changed, and I'm changed, and I
can't tell what's my name, or who I am!"</p>
<p>The bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink
significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was
a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from
doing mischief, at the very suggestion of which the self-important man
in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical
moment a fresh, comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at
the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which,
frightened at his looks, began to cry. "Hush, Rip," cried she, "hush,
you little fool; the old man won't hurt you." The name of the child, the
air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of
recollections in his mind. "What is your name, my good woman?" asked he.</p>
<p>"Judith Gardenier."</p>
<p>"And your father's name?"</p>
<p>"Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it's twenty years
since he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of
since,--his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or
was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a
little girl."</p>
<p>Rip had but one question more to ask; and he put it with a faltering
voice:--</p>
<p>"Where's your mother?"</p>
<p>"Oh, she too had died but a short time since; she broke a
blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler."</p>
<p>There was a drop of comfort at least, in this intelligence. The
honest man could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and
her child in his arms. "I am your father!" cried he--"Young Rip Van
Winkle once--old Rip Van Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van
Winkle?"</p>
<p>All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the
crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a
moment, exclaimed, "Sure enough, it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself!
Welcome home again, old neighbor--Why, where have you been these twenty
long years?"</p>
<p>Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to
him but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were
seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks; and
the self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over,
had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth and
shook his head--upon which there was a general shaking of the head
throughout the assemblage.</p>
<p>It was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter
Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a
descendant of the historian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest
accounts of the province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the
village, and well versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of
the neighborhood. He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story
in the most satisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a
fact, handed down from his ancestor the historian, that the Kaatskill
Mountains had always been haunted by strange beings. That it was
affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the
river and country, kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with
his crew of the Half-moon; being permitted in this way to revisit the
scenes of his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the
great city called by his name. That his father had once seen them in
their old Dutch dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the mountain;
and that he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their
balls like distant peals of thunder.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned to
the more important concerns of the election. Rip's daughter took him
home to live with her; she had a snug well-furnished house, and a stout
cheery farmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins
that used to climb upon his back. As to Rip's son and heir, who was the
ditto of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work
on the farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to anything
else but his business.</p>
<p>Rip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his
former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of
time; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with
whom he soon grew into great favor. Having nothing to do at home, and
being arrived at that happy age when a man can be idle with impunity, he
took his place once more on the bench at the inn door, and was
reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of
the old times "before the war." It was some time before he could get
into the regular track of gossip, or could be made to comprehend the
strange events that had taken place during his torpor. How that there
had been a revolutionary war--that the country had thrown off the yoke
of old England--and that, instead of being a subject of his Majesty
George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States. Rip,
in fact, was no politician; the changes of states and empires made but
little impression on him; but there was one species of despotism under
which he had long groaned, and that was--petticoat government. Happily
that was at an end; he had got his neck out of the yoke of matrimony,
and could go in and out whenever he pleased, without dreading the
tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her name was mentioned, however, he
shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and cast up his eyes, which
might pass either for an expression of resignation to his fate, or joy
at his deliverance.</p>
<p>He used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Mr.
Doolittle's hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points
every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so
recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have
related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood but knew it
by heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted
that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which
he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost
universally gave it full credit. Even to this day they never hear a
thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say
Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is a
common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life
hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out
of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.<br>

--OLD POEM.</small></p>
<p><br>
To an American visiting Europe, the long voyage he has to make is an
excellent preparative. The temporary absence of worldly scenes and
employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive new
and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters that separates the
hemispheres is like a blank page in existence. There is no gradual
transition, by which, as in Europe, the features and population of one
country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another. From the
moment you lose sight of the land you have left, all is vacancy until
you step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once into the bustle
and novelties of another world.</p>
<p>In traveling by land there is a continuity of scene and a connected
succession of persons and incidents, that carry on the story of life,
and lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, it is true, "a
lengthening chain," at each remove of our pilgrimage; but the chain is
unbroken: we can trace it back link by link; and we feel that the last
still grapples us to home. But a wide sea voyage severs us at once. It
makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of
settled life, and sent adrift upon a doubtful world. It interposes a
gulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and our homes--a gulf
subject to tempest, and fear, and uncertainty, rendering distance
palpable, and return precarious.</p>
<p>Such, at least, was the case with myself. As I saw the last blue
line of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon, it seemed
as if I had closed one volume of the world and its concerns, and had
time for meditation, before I opened another. That land, too, now
vanishing from my view, which contained all most dear to me in life;
what vicissitudes might occur in it--what changes might take place in
me, before I should visit it again! Who can tell, when he sets forth to
wander, whither he may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence;
or when he may return; or whether it may ever be his lot to revisit the
scenes of his childhood?</p>
<p>I said that at sea all is vacancy; I should correct the expression.
To one given to day-dreaming, and fond of losing himself in reveries, a
sea voyage is full of subjects for meditation: but then they are the
wonders of the deep, and of the air, and rather tend to abstract the
mind from worldly themes. I delighted to loll over the quarter-railing,
or climb to the maintop, of a calm day, and muse for hours together on
the tranquil bosom of a summer's sea; to gaze upon the piles of golden
clouds just peering above the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and
people them with, a creation of my own;--to watch the gentle undulating
billows, rolling their silver volumes, as if to die away on those happy
shores.</p>
<p>There was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with
which I looked down from my giddy height, on the monsters of the deep at
their uncouth gambols. Shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the
ship, the grampus slowly heaving his huge form above the surface; or the
ravenous shark, darting, like a spectre, through the blue waters. My
imagination would conjure up all that I had heard or read of the watery
world beneath me; of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys;
of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the
earth; and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and
sailors.</p>
<p>Sometimes a distant sail, gliding along the edge of the ocean, would
be another theme of idle speculation. How interesting this fragment of a
world, hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence! What a glorious
monument of human invention; which has in a manner triumphed over wind
and wave; has brought the ends of the world into communion; has
established an interchange of blessings, pouring into the sterile
regions of the north all the luxuries of the south; has diffused the
light of knowledge and the charities of cultivated life; and has thus
bound together those scattered portions of the human race, between which
nature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier.</p>
<p>We one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance. At
sea, everything that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse
attracts attention. It proved to be the mast of a ship that must have
been completely wrecked; for there were the remains of handkerchiefs, by
which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar, to prevent
their being washed off by the waves. There was no trace by which the
name of the ship could be ascertained. The wreck had evidently drifted
about for many months; clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it, and
long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides! But where, thought I, is the crew?
Their struggle has long been over--they have gone down amidst the roar
of the tempest--their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep.
Silence, oblivion, like the waves, have closed over them, and no one can
tell the story of their end. What sighs have been wafted after that
ship! what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home! How
often has the mistress, the wife, the mother, pored over the daily news,
to catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep! How has
expectation darkened into anxiety--anxiety into dread--and dread into
despair! Alas! not one memento may ever return for love to cherish. All
that may ever be known, is, that she sailed from her port, "and was
never heard of more!"</p>
<p>The sight of this wreck, as usual, gave rise to many dismal
anecdotes. This was particularly the case in the evening, when the
weather, which had hitherto been fair, began to look wild and
threatening, and gave indications of one of those sudden storms which
will sometimes break in upon the serenity of a summer voyage. As we sat
round the dull light of a lamp in the cabin, that made the gloom more
ghastly, every one had his tale of shipwreck and disaster. I was
particularly struck with a short one related by the captain.</p>
<p>"As I was once sailing," said he, "in a fine stout ship across the
banks of Newfoundland, one of those heavy fogs which prevail in those
parts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead even in the
daytime; but at night the weather was so thick that we could not
distinguish any object at twice the length of the ship. I kept lights at
the mast-head, and a constant watch forward to look out for fishing
smacks, which are accustomed to lie at anchor on the banks. The wind was
blowing a smacking breeze, and we were going at a great fate through the
water. Suddenly the watch gave the alarm of 'a sail ahead!'--it was
scarcely uttered before we were upon her. She was a small schooner, at
anchor, with her broadside towards us. The crew were all asleep, and had
neglected to hoist a light. We struck her just amidships. The force, the
size, the weight of our vessel bore her down below the waves; we passed
over her and were hurried on our course. As the crashing wreck was
sinking beneath us, I had a glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches
rushing from her cabin; they just started from their beds to be
swallowed shrieking by the waves. I heard their drowning cry mingling
with the wind. The blast that bore it to our ears swept us out of all
farther hearing. I shall never forget that cry! It was some time before
we could put the ship about, she was under such headway. We returned, as
nearly as we could guess, to the place where the smack had anchored. We
cruised about for several hours in the dense fog. We fired signal guns,
and listened if we might hear the halloo of any survivors: but all was
silent--we never saw or heard anything of them more."</p>
<p>I confess these stories, for a time, put an end to all my fine
fancies. The storm increased with the night. The sea was lashed into
tremendous confusion. There was a fearful, sullen sound of rushing
waves, and broken surges. Deep called unto deep. At times the black
column of clouds overhead seemed rent asunder by flashes of lightning
which quivered along the foaming billows, and made the succeeding
darkness doubly terrible. The thunders bellowed over the wild waste of
waters, and were echoed and prolonged by the mountain waves. As I saw
the ship staggering and plunging among these roaring caverns, it seemed
miraculous that she regained her balance, or preserved her buoyancy. Her
yards would dip into the water: her bow was almost buried beneath the
waves. Sometimes an impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm her, and
nothing but a dexterous movement of the helm preserved her from the
shock.</p>
<p>When I retired to my cabin, the awful scene still followed me. The
whistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like funereal
wailings. The creaking of the masts, the straining and groaning of
bulk-heads, as the ship labored in the weltering sea, were frightful. As
I heard the waves rushing along the sides of the ship, and roaring in my
very ear, it seemed as if Death were raging round this floating prison,
seeking for his prey: the mere starting of a nail, the yawning of a
seam, might give him entrance.</p>
<p>A fine day, however, with a tranquil sea and favoring breeze, soon
put all these dismal reflections to flight. It is impossible to resist
the gladdening influence of fine weather and fair wind at sea. When the
ship is decked out in all her canvas, every sail swelled, and careering
gayly over the curling waves, how lofty, how gallant she appears--how
she seems to lord it over the deep!</p>
<p>I might fill a volume with the reveries of a sea voyage, for with me
it is almost a continual reverie--but it is time to get to shore.</p>
<p>It was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of "land!" was
given from the mast-head. None but those who have experienced it can
form an idea of the delicious throng of sensations which rush into an
American's bosom, when he first comes in sight of Europe. There is a
volume of associations with the very name. It is the land of promise,
teeming with every thing of which his childhood has heard, or on which
his studious years have pondered.</p>
<p>From that time until the moment of arrival, it was all feverish
excitement. The ships of war, that prowled like guardian giants along
the coast; the headlands of Ireland, stretching out into the channel;
the Welsh mountains, towering into the clouds; all were objects of
intense interest. As we sailed up the Mersey I reconnoitred the shores
with a telescope. My eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages, with their
trim shrubberies and green grass plots. I saw the mouldering ruin of an
abbey overrun with ivy, and the taper spire of a village church rising
from the brow of a neighboring hill--all were characteristic of England.</p>
<p>The tide and wind were so favorable that the ship was enabled to
come at once to the pier. It was thronged with people; some, idle
lookers-on, others, eager expectants of friends or relatives. I could
distinguish the merchant to whom the ship was consigned. I knew him by
his calculating brow and restless air. His hands were thrust into his
pockets; he was whistling thoughtfully, and walking to and fro, a small
space having been accorded him by the crowd, in deference to his
temporary importance. There were repeated cheerings and salutations
interchanged between the shore and the ship, as friends happened to
recognize each other. I particularly noticed one young woman of humble
dress, but interesting demeanor. She was leaning forward from among the
crowd; her eye hurried over the ship as it neared the shore, to catch
some wished-for countenance. She seemed disappointed and agitated; when
I heard a faint voice call her name. It was from a poor sailor who had
been ill all the voyage, and had excited the sympathy of every one on
board. When the weather was fine, his messmates had spread a mattress
for him on deck in the shade, but of late his illness had so increased
that he had taken to his hammock, and only breathed a wish that he might
see his wife before he died. He had been helped on deck as we came up
the river, and was now leaning against the shrouds, with a countenance
so wasted, so pale, so ghastly, that it was no wonder even the eye of
affection did not recognize him. But at the sound of his voice, her eye
darted on his features; it read, at once, a whole volume of sorrow; she
clasped her hands, uttered a faint shriek, and stood wringing them in
silent agony.</p>
<p>All now was hurry and bustle. The meetings of acquaintances--the
greetings of friends--the consultations of men of business. I alone was
solitary and idle. I had no friend to meet, no cheering to receive. I
stepped upon the land of my forefathers--but felt that I was a stranger
in the land.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="NATHANIEL_HAWTHORNE"></a>NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE</p>
<p>The ancestors of Hawthorne, unlike those of most of the New England
writers, were not of the clergy, but were seamen, soldiers, and
magistrates. Concerning one of these, a judge who dealt harshly with the
Salem witches, Hawthorne writes: "I take shame upon myself for their
sakes and yet strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves
with mine." Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts, July 4, 1804,
and when only four years old lost his father, a sea captain.</p>
<p>The happiest years of his boyhood were spent at his uncle's home in
the forests of Maine. Here he loved to wander through the woods,
afterwards recording carefully his observations. His early education was
rather irregular; however, for a time he had for schoolmaster,
Worcester, the author of the dictionary. At Bowdoin college his studies
were largely literary. His life at college is chiefly remarkable for the
friendships formed there. Both Franklin Pierce, who later became
president of the United States, and Longfellow, the poet, were members
of his class.</p>
<p>After graduation in 1825, while Longfellow was traveling in many
lands and yielding himself to the charm of medi&aelig;val history and
legend, Hawthorne drifted into a strange mode of life, virtually
disappearing from the world for a dozen years and living in actual
solitude. "I have made a captive of myself," he wrote to Longfellow,
"and put me into a dungeon; and now I cannot find the key to let myself
out." But the key was found. The appreciation of Elizabeth and Sophia
Peabody and the deep affection for the latter acted as a spur to get him
into active life. At thirty-eight he married Sophia Peabody and took up
courageously enough a life of poverty and hard literary work at Concord
in the Old Manse, which had formerly been Emerson's home. There he came
to know and value the friendship of Emerson, who we may well believe was
the inspiration of the allegory of the Great Stone Face.</p>
<p>In curious contradiction with his natural love for solitude,
Hawthorne became interested in the experiment of communal life and spent
the year before his marriage at Brook Farm, where a number of literary
men tried to live simply and happily by combining intellectual and
manual work.</p>
<p>During the years of his solitude he wrote incessantly and composed
many of those sketches of the fancy which won for him his peculiar place
in literature. Many of these sketches appeared in the collection "Twice
Told Tales." For children he has written the little stories and
biographies of "Grandfather's Chair" and the story of Greek and Roman
Myths in his "Wonder-Book" and "Tanglewood Tales." Sin and the effect of
guilt upon human conduct are the problems in his great romances.</p>
<p>Many of our literary men have held public positions, sometimes to
help out the meager financial returns of literary work, but more often
because they would bring honor to these positions. Hawthorne
successively filled the offices of weigher and gauger in the Boston
Custom House, collector of customs at Salem, and American consul at
Liverpool, having been appointed as consul by his old friend President
Pierce. After four years' residence in England he resigned his
consulship and spent several years in travel on the continent, spending
two winters in Rome. Here he conceived his "Marble Faun," which, though
given an Italian setting, embodies the same problem of conscience that
we find in his earlier "Scarlet Letter."</p>
<p>In June, 1860, he returned to America. He was deeply agitated by the
Civil War, the more so because his sympathies were not entirely with his
Northern friends. In May, 1864, his old friend General Pierce suggested
that they make a journey to the scenes of their college days. On their
way they stopped at Plymouth, New Hampshire, and there, early on the
morning of the nineteenth, he passed quietly away.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_GREAT_STONE_FACE"></a>THE
GREAT STONE FACE</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</small></p>
<p>One afternoon, when the sun was going down, a mother and her little
boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking about the Great Stone
Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was plainly to be
seen, though miles away, with the sunshine brightening all its features.</p>
<p>And what was the Great Stone Face?</p>
<p>Embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains, there was a valley so
spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants. Some of these good
people dwelt in log-huts, with the black forest all around them, on the
steep and difficult hillsides. Others had their homes in comfortable
farm-houses, and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level
surfaces of the valley. Others, again, were congregated into populous
villages, where some wild, highland rivulet, tumbling down from its
birthplace in the upper mountain region, had been caught and tamed by
human cunning, and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton-factories.
The inhabitants of this valley, in short, were numerous, and of many
modes of life. But all of them, grown people and children, had a kind of
familiarity with the Great Stone Face, although some possessed the gift
of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many
of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her mood of
majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by
some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position
as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to resemble the features
of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan,
had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad
arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long
bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have
rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other.
True it is, that if the spectator approached too near, he lost the
outline of the gigantic visage, and could discern only a heap of
ponderous and gigantic rocks, piled in chaotic ruin one upon another.
Retracing his steps, however, the wondrous features would again be seen;
and the farther he withdrew from them, the more like a human face, with
all its original divinity intact, did they appear; until, as it grew dim
in the distance, with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains
clustering about it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive.</p>
<p>It was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood
with the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all the features were
noble, and the expression was at once grand and sweet, as if it were the
glow of a vast, warm heart, that embraced all mankind in its affections,
and had room for more. It was an education only to look at it. According
to the belief of many people, the valley owed much of its fertility to
this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it, illuminating
the clouds, and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine.</p>
<p>As we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at their
cottage-door, gazing at the Great Stone Face, and talking about it. The
child's name was Ernest.</p>
<p>"Mother," said he, while the Titanic visage smiled on him, "I wish
that it could speak, for it looks so very kindly that its voice must
needs be pleasant. If I were to see a man with such a face, I should
love him dearly."</p>
<p>"If an old prophecy should come to pass," answered his mother, "we
may see a man, some time or other, with exactly such a face as that."</p>
<p>"What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?" eagerly inquired Ernest.
"Pray tell me all about it!"</p>
<p>So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her,
when she herself was younger than little Ernest; a story, not of things
that were past, but of what was yet to come; a story, nevertheless, so
very old, that even the Indians, who formerly inhabited this valley, had
heard it from their forefathers, to whom, as they affirmed, it had been
murmured by the mountain streams, and whispered by the wind among the
tree-tops. The purport was, that, at some future day, a child should be
born hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest and noblest
personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should bear an
exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few old-fashioned
people, and young ones likewise, in the ardor of their hopes, still
cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy. But others, who had
seen more of the world, had watched and waited till they were weary, and
had beheld no man with such a face, nor any man that proved to be much
greater or nobler than his neighbors, concluded it to be nothing but an
idle tale. At all events, the great man of the prophecy had not yet
appeared.</p>
<p>"O mother, dear mother!" cried Ernest, clapping his hands above his
head, "I do hope that I shall live to see him!"</p>
<p>His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and felt that
it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy. So
she only said to him, "Perhaps you may."</p>
<p>And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. It was
always in his mind, whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face. He
spent his childhood in the log-cottage where he was born, and was
dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in many things, assisting her
much with his little hands, and more with his loving heart. In this
manner, from a happy yet often pensive child, he grew up to be a mild,
quiet, unobtrusive boy, and sun-browned with labor in the fields, but
with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads
who have been taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher,
save only that the Great Stone Face became one to him. When the toil of
the day was over, he would gaze at it for hours, until he began to
imagine that those vast features recognized him, and gave him a smile of
kindness and encouragement, responsive to his own look of veneration. We
must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake, although the
Face may have looked no more kindly at Ernest than at all the world
besides. But the secret was that the boy's tender and confiding
simplicity discerned what other people could not see; and thus the love,
which was meant for all, became his peculiar portion.</p>
<p>About this time there went a rumor throughout the valley, that the
great man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a resemblance to
the Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It seems that, many years
before, a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a
distant seaport, where, after getting together a little money, he had
set up as a shopkeeper. His name--but I could never learn whether it was
his real one, or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success
in life--was Gathergold. Being shrewd and active, and endowed by
Providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what
the world calls luck, he became an exceedingly rich merchant, and owner
of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ships. All the countries of the globe
appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to
the mountainous accumulation of this one man's wealth. The cold regions
of the north, almost within the gloom and shadow of the Arctic Circle,
sent him their tribute in the shape of furs; hot Africa sifted for him
the golden sands of her rivers, and gathered up the ivory tusks of her
great elephants out of the forests; the East came bringing him the rich
shawls, and spices, and teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and the
gleaming purity of large pearls. The ocean, not to be behindhand with
the earth, yielded up her mighty whales, that Mr. Gathergold might sell
their oil, and make a profit on it. Be the original commodity what it
might, it was gold within his grasp. It might be said of him, as of
Midas in the fable, that whatever he touched with his finger immediately
glistened, and grew yellow, and was changed at once into sterling metal,
or, which suited him still better, into piles of coin. And, when Mr.
Gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a
hundred years only to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his
native valley, and resolved to go back thither, and end his days where
he was born. With this purpose in view, he sent a skilful architect to
build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to
live in.</p>
<p>As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the valley that
Mr. Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and
vainly looked for, and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable
similitude of the Great Stone Face. People were the more ready to
believe that this must needs be the fact, when they beheld the splendid
edifice that rose, as if by enchantment, on the site of his father's old
weather-beaten farm-house. The exterior was of marble, so dazzlingly
white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in
the sunshine, like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his young
play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the touch of
transmutation, had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly
ornamented portico, supported by tall pillars, beneath which was a lofty
door, studded with silver knobs, and made of a kind of variegated wood
that had been brought from beyond the sea. The windows, from the floor
to the ceiling of each stately apartment, were composed, respectively,
of but one enormous pane of glass, so transparently pure that it was
said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere. Hardly
anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace; but it
was reported, and with good semblance of truth, to be far more gorgeous
than the outside, insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other
houses was silver or gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold's bedchamber,
especially, made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would
have been able to close his eyes there. But, on the other hand, Mr.
Gathergold was now so inured to wealth, that perhaps he could not have
closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way
beneath his eyelids.</p>
<p>In due time, the mansion was finished; next came the upholsterers,
with magnificent furniture; then, a whole troop of black and white
servants, the harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his own majestic
person, was expected to arrive at sunset. Our friend Ernest, meanwhile,
had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man, the noble man,
the man of prophecy, after so many ages of delay, was at length to be
made manifest to his native valley. He knew, boy as he was, that there
were a thousand ways in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast wealth,
might transform himself into an angel of beneficence, and assume a
control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the
Great Stone Face. Full of faith and hope, Ernest doubted not that what
the people said was true, and that now he was to behold the living
likeness of those wondrous features on the mountain-side. While the boy
was still gazing up the valley, and fancying, as he always did, that the
Great Stone Face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him, the
rumbling of wheels was heard, approaching swiftly along the winding road.</p>
<p>"Here he comes!" cried a group of people who were assembled to
witness the arrival. "Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!" A carriage,
drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the road. Within it,
thrust partly out of the window, appeared the physiognomy of the old
man, with a skin as yellow as if his own Midas-hand had transmuted it.
He had a low forehead, small, sharp eyes, puckered about with
innumerable wrinkles, and very thin lips, which he made still thinner by
pressing them forcibly together.</p>
<p>"The very image of the Great Stone Face!" shouted the people. "Sure
enough, the old prophecy is true; and here we have the great man come,
at last!"</p>
<p>And, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to believe
that here was the likeness which they spoke of. By the roadside there
chanced to be an old beggar-woman and two little beggar-children,
stragglers from some far-off region, who, as the carriage rolled onward,
held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices, most piteously
beseeching charity. A yellow claw--the very same that had clawed
together so much wealth--poked itself out of the coach-window, and dropt
some copper coins upon the ground; so that, though the great man's name
seems to have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have been
nicknamed Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest shout, and
evidently with as much good faith as ever, the people bellowed,--</p>
<p>"He is the very image of the Great Stone Pace!"</p>
<p>But Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid
visage, and gazed up the valley, where, amid a gathering mist, gilded by
the last sun beams, he could still distinguish those glorious features
which had impressed themselves into his soul. Their aspect cheered him.
What did the benign lips seem to say?</p>
<p>"He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!"</p>
<p>The years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had grown, to
be a young man now. He attracted little notice from the other
inhabitants of the valley; for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of
life, save that, when the labor of the day was over, he still loved to
go apart and gaze and meditate upon the Great Stone Face. According to
their idea of the matter, it was a folly, indeed, but pardonable,
inasmuch as Ernest was industrious, kind, and neighborly, and neglected
no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit. They knew not that
the Great Stone Face had become a teacher to him, and that the sentiment
which was expressed in it would enlarge the young man's heart, and fill
it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts. They knew not
that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books,
and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other
human lives. Neither did Ernest know that the thoughts and affections
which came to him so naturally, in the fields and at the fireside, and
wherever he communed with himself, were of a higher tone than those
which all men shared with him. A simple soul,--simple as when his mother
first taught him the old prophecy,--he beheld the marvelous features
beaming adown the valley, and still wondered that their human
counterpart was so long in making his appearance.</p>
<p>By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and the oddest
part of the matter was, that his wealth, which was the body and spirit
of his existence, had disappeared before his death, leaving nothing of
him but a living skeleton, covered over with a wrinkled, yellow skin.
Since the melting away of his gold, it had been very generally conceded
that there was no such striking resemblance, after all, betwixt the
ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the
mountainside. So the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime, and
quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease. Once in a
while, it is true, his memory was brought up in connection with the
magnificent palace which he had built, and which had long ago been
turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers, multitudes of
whom came, every summer, to visit that famous natural curiosity, the
Great Stone Face. Thus, Mr. Gathergold being discredited and thrown into
the shade, the man of prophecy was yet to come.</p>
<p>It so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many years
before, had enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal of hard
fighting, had now become an illustrious commander. Whatever he may be
called in history, he was known in camps and on the battle-field under
the nickname of Old Blood-and-Thunder. This war-worn veteran, being now
infirm with age and wounds, and weary of the turmoil of a military life,
and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet, that had so
long been ringing in his ears, had lately signified a purpose of
returning to his native valley, hoping to find repose where he
remembered to have left it. The inhabitants, his old neighbors and their
grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a
salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more enthusiastically,
it being affirmed that now, at last, the likeness of the Great Stone
Face had actually appeared. An aid-de-camp of Old Blood-and-Thunder,
traveling through the valley, was said to have been struck with the
resemblance. Moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the
general were ready to testify, on oath, that, to the best of their
recollection, the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the
majestic image, even when a boy, only that the idea had never occurred
to them at that period. Great, therefore, was the excitement throughout
the valley; and many people, who had never once thought of glancing at
the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time in gazing at
it, for the sake of knowing exactly how General Blood-and-Thunder looked.</p>
<p>On the day of the great festival, Ernest, with all the other people
of the valley, left their work, and proceeded to the spot where the
sylvan banquet was prepared. As he approached, the loud voice of the
Rev. Dr. Battleblast was heard, beseeching a blessing on the good things
set before them, and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor
they were assembled. The tables were arranged in a cleared space of the
woods, shut in by the surrounding trees, except where a vista opened
eastward, and afforded a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the
general's chair, which was a relic from the home of Washington, there
was an arch of verdant boughs, with the laurel profusely intermixed, and
surmounted by his country's banner, beneath which he had won his
victories. Our friend Ernest raised himself on his tiptoes, in hopes to
get a glimpse of the celebrated guest; but there was a mighty crowd
about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches, and to catch
any word that might fall from the general in reply; and a volunteer
company, doing duty as a guard, pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets
at any particularly quiet person among the throng. So Ernest, being of
an unobtrusive character, was thrust quite into the background, where he
could see no more of Old Blood-and-Thunder's physiognomy than if it had
been still blazing on the battle-field. To console himself, he turned
towards the Great Stone Face, which, like a faithful and long-remembered
friend, looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest.
Meanwhile, however, he could overhear the remarks of various
individuals, who were comparing the features of the hero with the face
on the distant mountain-side.</p>
<p>"'Tis the same face, to a hair!" cried one man, cutting a caper for
joy.</p>
<p>"Wonderfully like, that's a fact!" responded another.</p>
<p>"Like! why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder himself, in a monstrous
looking-glass!" cried a third. "And why not? He's the greatest man of
this or any other age, beyond a doubt."</p>
<p>And then all three of the speakers gave a great shout, which
communicated electricity to the crowd, and called forth a roar from a
thousand voices, that went reverberating for miles among the mountains,
until you might have supposed that the Great Stone Face had poured its
thunder-breath into the cry. All these comments, and this vast
enthusiasm, served the more to interest our friend; nor did he think of
questioning that now, at length, the mountain-visage had found its human
counterpart. It is true, Ernest had imagined that this long-looked-for
personage would appear in the character of a man of peace, uttering
wisdom, and doing good, and making people happy. But, taking an habitual
breadth of view, with all his simplicity, he contended that Providence
should choose its own method of blessing mankind, and could conceive
that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody
sword, should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so.</p>
<p>"The general! the general!" was now the cry. "Hush! silence! Old
Blood-and-Thunder's going to make a speech."</p>
<p>Even so; for, the cloth being removed, the general's health had been
drunk, amid shouts of applause, and he now stood upon his feet to thank
the company. Ernest saw him. There he was, over the shoulders of the
crowd, from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward,
beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel, and the banner
drooping as if to shade his brow! And there, too, visible in the same
glance, through the vista of the forest, appeared the Great Stone Face!
And was there, indeed, such a resemblance as the crowd had testified?
Alas, Ernest could not recognize it! He beheld a war-worn and
weather-beaten countenance, full of energy, and expressive of an iron
will; but the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad, tender sympathies, were
altogether wanting in Old Blood-and-Thunder's visage; and even if the
Great Stone Face had assumed his look of stern command, the milder
traits would still have tempered it.</p>
<p>"This is not the man of prophecy," sighed Ernest to himself, as he
made his way out of the throng. "And must the world wait longer yet?"</p>
<p>The mists had congregated about the distant mountain-side, and there
were seen the grand and awful features of the Great Stone Face, awful
but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills, and
enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple. As he looked,
Ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole
visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without motion of
the lips. It was probably the effect of the western sunshine, melting
through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the
object that he gazed at. But--as it always did--the aspect of his
marvelous friend made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.</p>
<p>"Fear not, Ernest," said his heart, even as if the Great Face were
whispering him,--"fear not, Ernest; he will come." More years sped
swiftly and tranquilly away. Ernest still dwelt in his native valley,
and was now a man of middle age. By imperceptible degrees, he had become
known among the people. Now, as heretofore, he labored for his bread,
and was the same simple-hearted man that he had always been. But he had
thought and felt so much, he had given so many of the best hours of his
life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind, that it seemed
as though he had been talking with the angels, and had imbibed a portion
of their wisdom unawares. It was visible in the calm and well-considered
beneficence of his daily life, the quiet stream of which had made a wide
green margin all along its course. Not a day passed by, that the world
was not the better because this man, humble as he was, had lived. He
never stepped aside from his own path, yet would always reach a blessing
to his neighbor. Almost involuntarily, too, he had become a preacher.
The pure and high simplicity of his thought, which, as one of its
manifestations, took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from
his hand, flowed also forth in speech. He uttered truths that wrought
upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him. His auditors, it may
be, never suspected that Ernest, their own neighbor and familiar friend,
was more than an ordinary man; least of all did Ernest himself suspect
it; but, inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet, came thoughts out of
his mouth that no other human lips had spoken.</p>
<p>When the people's minds had had a little time to cool, they were
ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity
between General Blood-and-Thunder's truculent physiognomy and the benign
visage on the mountain-side. But now, again, there were reports and many
paragraphs in the newspapers, affirming that the likeness of the Great
Stone Face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent
statesman. He, like Mr. Gathergold and Old Blood-and-Thunder, was a
native of the valley, but had left it in his early days, and taken up
the trades of law and politics. Instead of the rich man's wealth and the
warrior's sword, he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than both
together. So wonderfully eloquent was he, that whatever he might choose
to say, his auditors had no choice but to believe him; wrong looked like
right, and right like wrong; for when it pleased him, he could make a
kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath, and obscure the natural
daylight with it. His tongue, indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes
it rumbled like the thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest
music. It was the blast of war,--the song of peace; and it seemed to
have a heart in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was
a wondrous man; and when his tongue had acquired him all other
imaginable success,--when it had been heard in halls of state, and in
the courts of princes and potentates,--after it had made him known all
over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to shore,--it finally
persuaded his countrymen to select him for the Presidency. Before this
time,--indeed, as soon as he began to grow celebrated,--his admirers had
found out the resemblance between him and the Great Stone Face; and so
much were they struck by it, that throughout the country this
distinguished gentleman was known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The
phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his
political prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the Popedom,
nobody ever becomes President without taking a name other than his own.</p>
<p>While his friends were doing their best to make him President, Old
Stony Phiz, as he was called, set out on a visit to the valley where he
was born. Of course, he had no other object than to shake hands with his
fellow citizens, and neither thought nor cared about any effect which
his progress through the country might have upon the election.
Magnificent preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman;
a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of
the State, and all the people left their business and gathered along the
wayside to see him pass. Among these was Ernest. Though more than once
disappointed, as we have seen, he had such a hopeful and confiding
nature, that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful
and good. He kept his heart continually open, and thus was sure to catch
the blessing from on high when it should come. So now again, as
buoyantly as ever, he went forth to behold the likeness of the Great
Stone Face. The cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a great
clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so dense
and high that the visage of the mountain-side was completely hidden from
Ernest's eyes. All the great men of the neighborhood were there on
horseback; militia officers, in uniform; the member of Congress; the
sheriff of the county; the editors of newspapers; and many a farmer,
too, had mounted his patient steed, with his Sunday coat upon his back.
It really was a very brilliant spectacle, especially as there were
numerous banners flaunting over the cavalcade, on some of which were
gorgeous portraits of the illustrious statesman and the Great Stone
Face, smiling familiarly at one another, like two brothers. If the
pictures were to be trusted, the mutual resemblance, it must be
confessed, was marvelous. We must not forget to mention that there was a
band of music, which made the echoes of the mountains ring and
reverberate with the loud triumph of its strains; so that airy and
soul-thrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows, as
if every nook of his native valley had found a voice, to welcome the
distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was when the far-off
mountain precipice flung back the music; for then the Great Stone Face
itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus, in acknowledgment
that, at length, the man of prophecy was come.</p>
<p>All this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting
with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of Ernest kindled up, and
he likewise threw up his hat, and shouted, as loudly as the loudest,
"Huzza for the great man! Huzza for Old Stony Phiz!" But as yet he had
not seen him.</p>
<p>"Here he is, now!" cried those who stood near Ernest. "There! There!
Look at Old Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the Mountain, and see
if they are not as like as two twin-brothers!"</p>
<p>In the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche, drawn
by four white horses; and in the barouche, with his massive head
uncovered, sat the illustrious statesman, Old Stony Phiz himself.</p>
<p>"Confess it," said one of Ernest's neighbors to him, "the Great
Stone Face has met its match at last!"</p>
<p>Now, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the countenance
which was bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest did fancy that
there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the
mountain-side. The brow, with its massive depth and loftiness, and all
the other features, indeed, were boldly and strongly hewn, as if in
emulation of a more than heroic, of a Titanic model. But the sublimity
and stateliness, the grand expression of a divine sympathy, that
illuminated the mountain visage and etherealized its ponderous granite
substance into spirit, might here be sought in vain. Something had been
originally left out, or had departed. And therefore the marvelously
gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his
eyes, as of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty
faculties and little aims, whose life, with all its high performances,
was vague and empty, because no high purpose had endowed it with reality.</p>
<p>Still, Ernest's neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side, and
pressing him for an answer.</p>
<p>"Confess! confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man of the
Mountain?"</p>
<p>"No!" said Ernest, bluntly, "I see little or no likeness."</p>
<p>"Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!" answered his
neighbor; and again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz.</p>
<p>But Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent: for this
was the saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man who might have
fulfilled the prophecy, and had not willed to do so. Meantime, the
cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the barouches swept past him,
with the vociferous crowd in the rear, leaving the dust to settle down,
and the Great Stone Face to be revealed again, with the grandeur that it
had worn for untold centuries.</p>
<p>"Lo, here I am, Ernest!" the benign lips seemed to say. "I have
waited longer than thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not; the man will
come."</p>
<p>The years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one another's
heels. And now they began to bring white hairs, and scatter them over
the head of Ernest; they made reverend wrinkles across his forehead, and
furrows in his cheeks. He was an aged man. But not in vain had he grown
old: more than the white hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his
mind; his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions that Time had graved,
and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by
the tenor of a life. And Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought for,
undesired, had come the fame which so many seek, and made him known in
the great world, beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt
so quietly. College professors, and even the active men of cities, came
from far to see and converse with Ernest; for the report had gone abroad
that this simple husbandman had ideas unlike those of other men, not
gained from books, but of a higher tone,--a tranquil and familiar
majesty, as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends.
Whether it were sage, statesman, or philanthropist, Ernest received
these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from
boyhood, and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost, or lay
deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked together, his face
would kindle, unawares, and shine upon them, as with a mild evening
light. Pensive with the fulness of such discourse, his guests took leave
and went their way; and passing up the valley, paused to look at the
Great Stone Face, imagining that they had seen its likeness in a human
countenance, but could not remember where.</p>
<p>While Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a bountiful
Providence had granted a new poet to this earth. He, likewise, was a
native of the valley, but had spent the greater part of his life at a
distance from that romantic region, pouring out his sweet music amid the
bustle and din of cities. Often, however, did the mountains which had
been familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the
clear atmosphere of his poetry. Neither was the Great Stone Face
forgotten, for the poet had celebrated it in an ode, which was grand
enough to have been uttered by its own majestic lips. This man of
genius, we may say, had come down from heaven with wonderful endowments.
If he sang of a mountain, the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier
grandeur reposing on its breast, or soaring to its summit, than had
before been seen there. If his theme were a lovely lake, a celestial
smile had now been thrown over it, to gleam forever on its surface. If
it were the vast old sea, even the deep immensity of its dread bosom
seemed to swell the higher, as if moved by the emotions of the song.
Thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that
the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. The Creator had bestowed him,
as the last best touch to his own handiwork. Creation was not finished
till the poet came to interpret, and so complete it.</p>
<p>The effect was no less high and beautiful, when his human brethren
were the subject of his verse. The man or woman, sordid with the common
dust of life, who crossed his daily path, and the little child who
played in it, were glorified if he beheld them in his mood of poetic
faith. He showed the golden links of the great chain that intertwined
them with an angelic kindred; he brought out the hidden traits of a
celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin. Some, indeed, there
were, who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by affirming
that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the
poet's fancy. Let such men speak for themselves, who undoubtedly appear
to have been spawned forth by Nature with a contemptuous bitterness; she
having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff, after all the swine
were made. As respects all things else, the poet's ideal was the truest
truth.</p>
<p>The songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read them after
his customary toil, seated on the bench before his cottage-door, where
for such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought, by
gazing at the Great Stone Face. And now as he read stanzas that caused
the soul to thrill within him, he lifted his eyes to the vast
countenance beaming on him so benignantly.</p>
<p>"O majestic friend," he murmured, addressing the Great Stone Face,
"is not this man worthy to resemble thee?"</p>
<p>The Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away, had not
only heard of Ernest, but had meditated much upon his character, until
he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man, whose untaught
wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life. One
summer morning, therefore, he took passage by the railroad, and, in the
decline of the afternoon, alighted from the cars at no great distance
from Ernest's cottage. The great hotel, which had formerly been the
palace of Mr. Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his
carpetbag on his arm, inquired at once where Ernest dwelt, and was
resolved to be accepted as his guest.</p>
<p>Approaching the door, he there found the good old man, holding a
volume in his hand, which alternately he read, and then, with a finger
between the leaves, looked lovingly at the Great Stone Face.</p>
<p>"Good evening," said the poet. "Can you give a traveler a night's
lodging?"</p>
<p>"Willingly," answered Ernest; and then he added, smiling, "Methinks
I never saw the Great Stone Face look so hospitably at a stranger."</p>
<p>The poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest talked
together. Often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the
wisest, but never before with a man like Ernest, whose thoughts and
feelings gushed up with such a natural freedom, and who made great
truths so familiar by his simple utterance of them. Angels, as had been
so often said, seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the
fields; angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside; and,
dwelling with angels as friend with friends, he had imbibed the
sublimity of their ideas, and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm
of household words. So thought the poet. And Ernest, on the other hand,
was moved and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of
his mind, and which peopled all the air about the cottage-door with
shapes of beauty, both gay and pensive. The sympathies of these two men
instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have attained
alone. Their minds accorded into one strain, and made delightful music
which neither of them could have claimed as all his own, nor
distinguished his own share from the other's. They led one another, as
it were, into a high pavilion of their thoughts, so remote, and hitherto
so dim, that they had never entered it before, and so beautiful that
they desired to be there always.</p>
<p>As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great Stone
Face was bending forward to listen too. He gazed earnestly into the
poet's glowing eyes.</p>
<p>"Who are you, my strangely gifted guest?" he said. The poet laid his
finger on the volume that Ernest had been reading.</p>
<p>"You have read these poems," said he. "You know me, then,--for I
wrote them."</p>
<p>Again, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined the
poet's features; then turned towards the Great Stone Face; then back,
with an uncertain aspect, to his guest. But his countenance fell; he
shook his head, and sighed.</p>
<p>"Wherefore are you sad?" inquired the poet.</p>
<p>"Because," replied Ernest, "all through life I have awaited the
fulfilment of a prophecy; and, when I read these poems, I hoped that it
might be fulfilled in you."</p>
<p>"You hoped," answered the poet, faintly smiling, "to find in me the
likeness of the Great Stone Face. And you are disappointed, as formerly
with Mr. Gathergold, and Old Blood-and-Thunder, and Old Stony Phiz. Yes,
Ernest, it is my doom. You must add my name to the illustrious three,
and record another failure of your hopes. For--in shame and sadness do I
speak it, Ernest--I am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and
majestic image."</p>
<p>"And why?" asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume. "Are not those
thoughts divine?"</p>
<p>"They have a strain of the Divinity," replied the poet. "You can
hear in them the far-off echo of a heavenly song. But my life, dear
Ernest, has not corresponded with my thought. I have had grand dreams,
but they have been only dreams, because I have lived--and that, too, by
my own choice--among poor and mean realities. Sometimes even--shall I
dare to say it?--I lack faith in the grandeur, the beauty, and the
goodness, which my own works are said to have made more evident in
nature and in human life. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and true,
shouldst thou hope to find me, in yonder image of the divine?"</p>
<p>The poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tears. So,
likewise, were those of Ernest.</p>
<p>At the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom, Ernest
was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the
open air. He and the poet, arm in arm, still talking together as they
went along, proceeded to the spot. It was a small nook among the hills,
with a gray precipice behind, the stern front of which was relieved by
the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants that made a tapestry for
the naked rock, by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles. At
a small elevation above the ground, set in a rich framework of verdure,
there appeared a niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure, with
freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and
genuine emotion. Into this natural pulpit Ernest ascended, and threw a
look of familiar kindness around upon his audience. They stood, or sat,
or reclined upon the grass, as seemed good to each, with the departing
sunshine falling obliquely over them, and mingling its subdued
cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient trees, beneath and
amid the boughs of which the golden rays were constrained to pass. In
another direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the same cheer,
combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant aspect.</p>
<p>Ernest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his heart
and mind. His words had power, because they accorded with his thoughts;
and his thoughts had reality and depth, because they harmonized with the
life which he had always lived. It was not mere breath that this
preacher uttered; they were the words of life, because a life of good
deeds and holy love was melted into them. Pearls, pure and rich, had
been dissolved into this precious draught. The poet, as he listened,
felt that the being and character of Ernest were a nobler strain of
poetry than he had ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he
gazed reverentially at the venerable man, and said within himself that
never was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that
mild, sweet, thoughtful countenance, with the glory of white hair
diffused about it. At a distance, but distinctly to be seen, high up in
the golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone Face, with
hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the brow of Ernest.
Its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world.</p>
<p>At that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was about to
utter, the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression, so imbued
with benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible impulse, threw his
arms aloft, and shouted,--</p>
<p>"Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone
Face!"</p>
<p>Then all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted poet
said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled. But Ernest, having finished
what he had to say, took the poet's arm, and walked slowly homeward,
still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by
appear, bearing a resemblance to the GREAT STONE FACE.<br>

VISIT TO NIAGARA</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</small></p>
<p>Never did a pilgrim approach Niagara with deeper enthusiasm than
mine. I had lingered away from it, and wandered to other scenes, because
my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising all the wonders of the
world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loath to exchange the
pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon. At length the day came.
The stage-coach, with a Frenchman and myself on the back seat, had
already left Lewiston, and in less than an hour would set us down in
Manchester. I began to listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled
with a sensation like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of
ages must roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman
stretched himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while,
by a sudden impulse, I threw myself back and closed my eyes. When the
scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst of
Niagara was yet in futurity. We rolled on, and entered the village of
Manchester, bordering on the falls.</p>
<p>I am quite ashamed of myself here. Not that I ran like a madman to
the falls, and plunged into the thickest of the spray,--never stopping
to breathe, till breathing was impossible; not that I committed this, or
any other suitable extravagance. On the contrary, I alighted with
perfect decency and composure, gave my cloak to the black waiter,
pointed out my baggage, and inquired, not the nearest way to the
cataract, but about the dinner-hour. The interval was spent in arranging
my dress. Within the last fifteen minutes, my mind had grown strangely
benumbed, and my spirits apathetic, with a slight depression, not
decided enough to be termed sadness. My enthusiasm was in a deathlike
slumber. Without aspiring to immortality, as he did, I could have
imitated that English traveller, who turned back from the point where he
first heard the thunder of Niagara, after crossing the ocean to behold
it. Many a Western trader, by the by, has performed a similar act of
heroism with more heroic simplicity, deeming it no such wonderful feat
to dine at the hotel and resume his route to Buffalo or Lewiston, while
the cataract was roaring unseen.</p>
<p>Such has often been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and
earnestly desired, were placed within my reach. After dinner--at which
an unwonted and perverse epicurism detained me longer than usual--I
lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely attentive to the aspect
and business of a very ordinary village. Finally, with reluctant step,
and the feeling of an intruder, I walked towards Goat Island. At the
toll-house, there were farther excuses for delaying the inevitable
moment. My signature was required in a huge ledger, containing similar
records innumerable, many of which I read. The skin of a great sturgeon,
and other fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such
as lie in heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other
trifles, made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several
newspapers, from Montreal, New York, and Boston,--all attracted me in
turn. Out of a number of twisted sticks, the manufacture of a Tuscarora
Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously convoluted, and
adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish. Using this as my
pilgrim's staff, I crossed the bridge. Above and below me were the
rapids, a river of impetuous snow, with here and there a dark rock amid
its whiteness, resisting all the physical fury, as any cold spirit did
the moral influences of the scene. On reaching Goat Island, which
separates the two great segments of the falls, I chose the right-hand
path, and followed it to the edge of the American cascade. There, while
the falling sheet was yet invisible, I saw the vapor that never
vanishes, and the Eternal Rainbow of Niagara.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon of glorious sunshine, without a cloud, save
those of the cataracts. I gained an insulated rock, and beheld a broad
sheet of brilliant and unbroken foam, not shooting in a curbed line from
the top of the precipice, but falling, headlong down from height to
depth. A narrow stream diverged from the main branch, and hurried over
the crag by a channel of its own, leaving a little pine-clad island and
a streak of precipice between itself and the larger sheet. Below arose
the mist, on which was painted a dazzling sunbow with two concentric
shadows,--one, almost as perfect as the original brightness; and the
other, drawn faintly round the broken edge of the cloud.</p>
<p>Still I had not half seen Niagara. Following the verge of the
island, the path led me to the Horseshoe, where the real, broad St.
Lawrence, rushing along on a level with its banks, pours its whole
breadth over a concave line of precipice, and thence pursues its course
between lofty crags towards Ontario. A sort of bridge, two or three feet
wide, stretches out along the edge of the descending sheet, and hangs
upon the rising mist, as if that were the foundation of the frail
structure. Here I stationed myself in the blast of wind, which the
rushing river bore along with it. The bridge was tremulous beneath me,
and marked the tremor of the solid earth. I looked along the whitening
rapids, and endeavored to distinguish a mass of water far above the
falls, to follow it to their verge, and go down with it, in fancy, to
the abyss of clouds and storm. Casting my eyes across the river, and
every side, I took in the whole scene at a glance, and tried to
comprehend it in one vast idea. After an hour thus spent, I left the
bridge, and by a staircase, winding almost interminably round a post,
descended to the base of the precipice. From that point, my path lay
over slippery stones, and among great fragments of the cliff, to the
edge of the cataract, where the wind at once enveloped me in spray, and
perhaps dashed the rainbow round me. Were my long desires fulfilled? And
had I seen Niagara?</p>
<p>Oh that I had never heard of Niagara till I beheld it! Blessed were
the wanderers of old, who heard its deep roar, sounding through the
woods, as the summons to an unknown wonder, and approached its awful
brink, in all the freshness of native feeling. Had its own mysterious
voice been the first to warn me of its existence, then, indeed, I might
have knelt down and worshipped. But I had come thither, haunted with a
vision of foam and fury, and dizzy cliffs, and an ocean tumbling down
out of the sky,--a scene, in short, which nature had too much good taste
and calm simplicity to realize. My mind had struggled to adapt these
false conceptions to the reality, and finding the effort vain, a
wretched sense of disappointment weighed me down. I climbed the
precipice, and threw myself on the earth, feeling that I was unworthy to
look at the Great Falls, and careless about beholding them again.</p>
<p>All that night, as there has been and will be for ages past and to
come, a rushing sound was heard, as if a great tempest were sweeping
through the air. It mingled with my dreams, and made them full of storm
and whirlwind. Whenever I awoke, and heard this dread sound in the air,
and the windows rattling as with a mighty blast, I could not rest again,
till looking forth, I saw how bright the stars were, and that every leaf
in the garden was motionless. Never was a summer night more calm to the
eye, nor a gale of autumn louder to the ear. The rushing sound proceeds
from the rapids, and the rattling of the casements is but an effect of
the vibration of the whole house, shaken by the jar of the cataract. The
noise of the rapids draws the attention from the true voice of Niagara,
which is a dull, muffled thunder, resounding between the cliffs. I spent
a wakeful hour at midnight, in distinguishing its reverberations, and
rejoiced to find that my former awe and enthusiasm were reviving.</p>
<p>Gradually, and after much contemplation, I came to know, by my own
feelings, that Niagara is indeed a wonder of the world, and not the less
wonderful, because time and thought must be employed in comprehending
it. Casting aside all preconceived notions, and preparation to be
dire-struck or delighted, the beholder must stand beside it in the
simplicity of his heart, suffering the mighty scene to work its own
impression. Night after night, I dreamed of it, and was gladdened every
morning by the consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it. Yet I
will not pretend to the all-absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate
spectators, nor deny that very trifling causes would draw my eyes and
thoughts from the cataract.</p>
<p>The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my departure for
the Far West, I sat upon the Table Rock. This celebrated station did not
now, as of old, project fifty feet beyond the line of the precipice, but
was shattered by the fall of an immense fragment, which lay distant on
the shore below. Still, on the utmost verge of the rock, with my feet
hanging over it, I felt as if suspended in the open air. Never before
had my mind been in such perfect unison with the scene. There were
intervals, when I was conscious of nothing but the great river, lolling
calmly into the abyss, rather descending than precipitating itself, and
acquiring tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion. It came like the
march of Destiny. It was not taken by surprise, but seemed to have
anticipated, in all its course through the broad lakes, that it must
pour their collected waters down this height. The perfect foam of the
river, after its descent, and the ever-varying shapes of mist, rising
up, to become clouds in the sky, would be the very picture of confusion,
were it merely transient, like the rage of a tempest. But when the
beholder has stood awhile, and perceives no lull in the storm, and
considers that the vapor and the foam are as everlasting as the rocks
which produce them, all this turmoil assumes a sort of calmness. It
soothes, while it awes the mind.</p>
<p>Leaning over the cliff, I saw the guide conducting two adventurers
behind the falls. It was pleasant, from that high seat in the sunshine,
to observe them struggling against the eternal storm of the lower
regions, with heads bent down, now faltering, now pressing forward, and
finally swallowed up in their victory. After their disappearance, a
blast rushed out with an old hat, which it had swept from one of their
heads. The rock, to which they were directing their unseen course, is
marked, at a fearful distance on the exterior of the sheet, by a jet of
foam. The attempt to reach it appears both poetical and perilous to a
looker-on, but may be accomplished without much more difficulty or
hazard than in stemming a violent northeaster. In a few moments, forth
came the children of the mist. Dripping and breathless, they crept along
the base of the cliff, ascended to the guide's cottage, and received, I
presume, a certificate of their achievement, with three verses of
sublime poetry on the back.</p>
<p>My contemplations were often interrupted by strangers who came down
from Forsyth's to take their first view of the falls. A short, ruddy,
middle-aged gentleman, fresh from Old England, peeped over the rock, and
evinced his approbation by a broad grin. His spouse, a very robust lady,
afforded a sweet example of maternal solicitude, being so intent on the
safety of her little boy that she did not even glance at Niagara. As for
the child,--he gave himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy.
Another traveller, a native American, and no rare character among us,
produced a volume of Captain Hall's tour, and labored earnestly to
adjust Niagara to the captain's description, departing, at last, without
one new idea or sensation of his own. The next comer was provided, not
with a printed book, but with a blank sheet of foolscap, from top to
bottom of which, by means of an ever-pointed pencil, the cataract was
made to thunder. In a little talk which we had together, he awarded his
approbation to the general view, but censured the position of Goat
Island, observing that it should have been thrown farther to the right,
so as to widen the American falls, and contract those of the Horseshoe.
Next appeared two traders of Michigan, who declared, that, upon the
whole, the sight was worth looking at; there certainly was an immense
water-power here; but that, after all, they would go twice as far to see
the noble stone-works of Lockport, where the Grand Canal is locked down
a descent of sixty feet. They were succeeded by a young fellow, in a
homespun cotton dress, with a staff in his hand, and a pack over his
shoulders. He advanced close to the edge of the rock, where his
attention, at first wavering among the different components of the
scene, finally became fixed in the angle of the Horseshoe falls, which
is, indeed the central point of interest. His whole soul seemed to go
forth and be transported thither, till the staff slipped from his
relaxed grasp, and falling down--down--down--struck upon the fragment of
the Table Rock.</p>
<p>In this manner I spent some hours, watching the varied impression,
made by the cataract, on those who disturbed me, and returning to
unwearied contemplation, when left alone. At length my time came to
depart. There is a grassy footpath through the woods, along the summit
of the bank, to a point whence a causeway, hewn in the side of the
precipice, goes winding down to the Ferry, about half a mile below the
Table Rock. The sun was near setting, when I emerged from the shadow of
the trees, and began the descent. The indirectness of my downward road
continually changed the point of view, and showed me, in rich and
repeated succession, now, the whitening rapids and majestic leap of the
main river, which appeared more deeply massive as the light departed;
now, the lovelier picture, yet still sublime, of Goat Island, with its
rocks and grove, and the lesser falls, tumbling over the right bank of
the St. Lawrence, like a tributary stream; now, the long vista of the
river, as it eddied and whirled between the cliffs, to pass through
Ontario toward the sea, and everywhere to be wondered at, for this one
unrivalled scene. The golden sunshine tinged the sheet of the American
cascade, and painted on its heaving spray the broken semi-circle of a
rainbow, heaven's own beauty crowning earth's sublimity. My steps were
slow, and I paused long at every turn of the descent, as one lingers and
pauses who discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in what he
must soon behold no more. The solitude of the old wilderness now reigned
over the whole vicinity of the falls. My enjoyment became the more
rapturous, because no poet shared it, nor wretch devoid of poetry
profaned it; but the spot so famous through the world was all my own!<br>

ALLAN POE</span></p>
<p>So irregular was the life of Edgar Allan Poe and so strong were the
prejudices of his critics that not only his character and habits of
life, but even the simplest facts of his biography, are surrounded with
mystery and are subjects of doubt and dispute.</p>
<p>By everything, but the accident of birth, Poe belongs to the South.
His father was from Baltimore and his mother was of English birth. They
were both members of a theatrical company playing in Boston at the time
of Poe's birth, January 19, 1809. At the age of three he was left an
orphan by the death of his mother. A wealthy Scotchman of Virginia, Mr.
John Allan, adopted him and brought him up in luxury--a much spoiled
child, everywhere petted for his beauty and precocity.</p>
<p>He was sent to school in a suburb of London and upon his return to
America entered the University of Virginia, a proud, reserved, and
self-willed youth. Here he led an irregular life, so that Mr. Allan was
forced to withdraw him from school and gave him work in his office. The
routine of office work was very distasteful to Poe and he ran away to
Boston, where he published his first volume of poems. Here he enlisted
in the army, but when Mr. Allan heard of his whereabouts he secured his
discharge and obtained an appointment for him, as a cadet, at West
Point. The severe discipline of that school proved irksome to his
restless nature and after a few months he brought upon himself his
dismissal. At the age of twenty-two he found himself adrift with nothing
further to expect from Mr. Allan.</p>
<p>Literature presented itself as his most natural vocation. He had
written poetry from the pure love of it, but now actual poverty drove
him to the more remunerative prose writing. He engaged in journalistic
work in Baltimore, living with his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, and her daughter,
Virginia. Two years later he married Virginia Clemm, a mere child; but
Poe, whose reverence for women was his noblest trait, loved her and
cared for her through poverty and ill-health, until her death eleven
years later, a short time before his own. His life was a melancholy one,
a fierce struggle and final defeat. In 1849, on his way to New York from
Richmond, chance brought him and election day together in the city of
Baltimore. He was found in an election booth, delirious, and died a few
days later.</p>
<p>Poe was a keen critic of the literary men of his day, but he applied
the same standards to himself. He was constantly re-writing and
polishing what he had written. Poe's greatness lay in his imaginative,
work--his tales and his poems. The tales may be said to constitute a
distinct addition to the world's literature. From time immemorial, there
have been tales in prose and in verse, tales legendary, romantic, and
humorous, but never any quite like Poe's.</p>
<p>The appeal of his poetry is to the sentiment of beauty--the one
appeal, which according to his theory is the final justification of any
poem. Language is made to yield its utmost of melody. "The Raven" was
first published in January, 1845, and immediately became and remains one
of the most widely known of English poems. It can be mentioned anywhere,
without apology or explanation and there is scarcely a lover of
melodious verse who cannot repeat many of its lines and stanzas.</p>
<p>Every reader of Poe's prose will be impressed with the charm of the
language itself, the fascination of the vivid scenes and the magic touch
like the Necromancer's wand, which removes these scenes into the
uncharted realm of the supernatural and invests them with a kind of
sacred awe.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>EDGAR ALLAN POE</small></p>
<p>We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes
the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.</p>
<p>"Not long ago," said he at length, "and I could have guided you on
this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years
past, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to
mortal man--or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the
six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body
and soul. You suppose me a <i>very</i> old man--but I am not. It took
less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to
white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble
at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can
scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?"</p>
<p>The "little cliff," upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown
himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over
it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on
its extreme and slippery edge--this "little cliff" arose, a sheer
unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen
hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have
tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply
was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at
full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared
not even glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest
myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in
danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason
myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.</p>
<p>"You must get over these fancies," said the guide, "for I have
brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene
of that event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot
just under your eye.</p>
<p>"We are now," he continued, in that particularizing manner which
distinguished him--"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the
sixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--and
in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is
Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to
the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapor
beneath us, into the sea."</p>
<p>I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters
wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian
geographer's account of the <i>Mare Tenebrarum</i>. A panorama more
deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right and
left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like
ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose
character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf
which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest, howling and
shrieking forever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were
placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there
was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its
position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was
enveloped. About two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller
size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals
by a cluster of dark rocks.</p>
<p>The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant
island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at
the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the
remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly
plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a
regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross-dashing of water in
every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam
there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.</p>
<p>"The island in the distance," resumed the old man, "is called by the
Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the
northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm, Suarven,
and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm,
Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm. These are the true names of the
places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is
more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you
see any change in the water?"</p>
<p>We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to
which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had
caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.
As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing
sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American
prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the <i>chopping</i>
character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current
which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed--to its headlong
impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed
into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the
main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and
scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into
frenzied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic and
innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward
with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes, except in
precipitous descents.</p>
<p>In a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical
alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the
whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam
became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at
length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into
combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided
vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.
Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence,
in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was
represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this
slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as
the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining and jet-black wall of
water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,
speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion,
and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half
roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in
its agony to Heaven.</p>
<p>The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw
myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of
nervous agitation.</p>
<p>"This," said I at length, to the old man--"this <i>can</i> be
nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstr&ouml;m."</p>
<p>"So it is sometimes termed," said he. "We Norwegians call it the
Moskoe-str&ouml;m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway."</p>
<p>The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for
what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which, is perhaps the most
circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of
the magnificence or of the horror of the scene--or of the wild
bewildering sense of <i>the novel</i> which confounds the beholder. I am
not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor
at what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of
Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are some passages of his
description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details,
although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression
of the spectacle.</p>
<p>"Between Lofoden and Moskoe," he says, "the depth of the water is
between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver
(Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage
for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens
even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the
country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the
roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equaled by the loudest
and most dreadful cataracts, the noise being heard several leagues off;
and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship
comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down
to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the
water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these
intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and
in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence
gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury
heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of
it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding
against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens
frequently that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by
its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howling and
bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear
once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the
stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on
shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the
current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew
upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks,
among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the
flux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water every
six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday,
it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the
houses on the coast fell to the ground."</p>
<p>In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could
have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.
The "forty fathoms" must have reference only to portions of the channel
close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the
center of the Moskoe-str&ouml;m must be immeasurably greater; and no
better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even
the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from
the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the
howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity
with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of
belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to
me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest ships of the line in
existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could
resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear
bodily and at once.</p>
<p>The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I
remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a
very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is
that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe Islands,
"have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at
flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines
the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the
higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural
result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which
is sufficiently known by lesser experiments."--These are the words of
the "Encyclopaedia Brittanica." Kircher and others imagine that in the
center of the channel of the Maelstr&ouml;m is an abyss penetrating the
globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia being
somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,
was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;
and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say
that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the
subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the
former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I
agreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether
unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.</p>
<p>"You have had a good look at the whirl now," said the old man, "and
if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden
the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I
ought to know something of the Moskoe-str&ouml;m."</p>
<p>I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.</p>
<p>"Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of
about seventy tons burden, with which we were in the habit of fishing
among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies
at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only
the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen
we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to
the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down
to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,
and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here
among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far
greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day what the more
timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made
it a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead
of labor, and courage answering for capital.</p>
<p>"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast
than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage
of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the
Moskoe-str&ouml;m, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage
somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so
violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for
slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out
upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and
coming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and
we seldom made a miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six
years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead
calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to
remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale
which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too
boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been
driven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirlpools threw us
round and round so violently that, at length, we fouled our anchor and
dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the
innumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove
us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.</p>
<p>"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
encountered 'on the ground'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in good
weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
Moskoe-str&ouml;m itself without accident; although at times my heart
has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or
before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it
at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while
the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son
eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have
been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as
afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves,
we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for,
after all said and done, it <i>was</i> a horrible danger, and that is
the truth.</p>
<p>"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to
tell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the
people of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one in
which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the
heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the
afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwest,
while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could
not have foreseen what was to follow.</p>
<p>"The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to
the islands about two o'clock P.M., and soon nearly loaded the smack
with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than
we had ever known them. It was just seven, <i>by my watch</i>, when we
weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Str&ouml;m
at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.</p>
<p>"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some
time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed
we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were
taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most
unusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began to
feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on
the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was
upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking
astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored
cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.</p>
<p>"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we
were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of
things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about
it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two the
sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, it
became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.</p>
<p>"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.
The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything like it. We had
let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the
first puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed
off--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed
himself to it for safety.</p>
<p>"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon
water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the
bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when
about to cross the Str&ouml;m, by way of precaution against the chopping
seas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we
lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped
destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of
ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I
threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of
the bow, and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the
foremast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was
undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too much
flurried to think.</p>
<p>"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this
time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no
longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,
and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a
shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid
herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the
better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so
as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was
my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that
he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned into
horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word '<i>Moskoe-str&ouml;m!</i>'</p>
<p>"No one will ever know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook
from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I
knew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished
to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound
for the whirl of the Str&ouml;m, and nothing could save us!</p>
<p>"You perceive that in crossing the Str&ouml;m <i>channel</i>, we
always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,
and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were
driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To
be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is
some little hope in that'--but in the next moment I cursed myself for
being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that
we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.</p>
<p>"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or
perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it; but at all
events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay
flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular
change, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was
still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at
once, a circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a
deep bright blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a
luster that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up everything about
us with the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to
light up!</p>
<p>"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some
manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I
could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of
my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as
death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say <i>listen!</i></p>
<p>"At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous
thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not
going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears
as I flung it far away into the ocean. <i>It had run down at seven
o'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the
Str&ouml;m was in full fury!</i></p>
<p>"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden,
the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip
from beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this is
what is called <i>riding</i>, in sea phrase.</p>
<p>"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently
a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us
with it as it rose--up--up--as if into the sky. I would not have
believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a
sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I
was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were
up I had thrown a quick glance around--and that one glance was
all-sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The
Moskoe-str&ouml;m whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead
ahead--but no more like the everyday Moskoe-str&ouml;m, than the whirl
as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were,
and what we had to expect, I should not have recognized the place at
all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids
clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.</p>
<p>"It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we
suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat
made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new
direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of
the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a
sound as you might imagine given out by the waterpipes of many thousand
steam vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the
belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,
that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could
only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we
were borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all,
but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her
starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world
of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and
the horizon.</p>
<p>"It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of
the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.
Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of
that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that
strung my nerves.</p>
<p>"It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to
reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how
foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own
individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.
I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.
After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about
the whirl itself. I positively felt a <i>wish</i> to explore its depths,
even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was
that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the
mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy
a man's mind in such extremity--and I have often thought since, that the
revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little
light-headed.</p>
<p>"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not
reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt of
surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this
latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you
have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the
confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind,
deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action or
reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these
annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prisons are allowed petty
indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.</p>
<p>"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.
We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than
floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,
and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I
had never let go of the ringbolt. My brother was at the stern, holding
on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the
coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been
swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink
of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from
which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as
it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt
deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew he
was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did
not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make
no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the
bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in
doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even
keel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of
the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we
gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I
muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.</p>
<p>"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds
I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and
wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.
But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had
ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,
while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more
along. I took courage and looked once again upon the scene.</p>
<p>"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration
with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by
magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in
circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides
might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity
with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance
they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift
amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of
golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost
recesses of the abyss.</p>
<p>"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I
recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.
In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the
manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She
was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane
parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of
more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our
beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely
more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,
than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to
the speed at which we revolved.</p>
<p>"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the
profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account
of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which
there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge
which Mussulmans say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This
mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great
walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the
yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist, I dare not
attempt to describe.</p>
<p>"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above,
had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our farther
descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not
with any uniform movement, but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent
us sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete
circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was
slow, but very perceptible.</p>
<p>"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we
were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in
the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments
of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with
many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,
barrels, and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity
which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow
upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to
watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our
company. I <i>must</i> have been delirious--for I even sought <i>amusement</i>
in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents
toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time
saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge
and disappears,'--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of
a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after
making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this
fact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of
reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily
once more.</p>
<p>"It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a
more exciting <i>hope</i>. This hope arose partly from memory, and
partly from present observation. I called to mind the great variety of
buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed
and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-str&ouml;m. By far the greater
number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so
chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of
splinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were <i>some</i>
of them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for
this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were
the only ones which had been <i>completely absorbed</i>--that the
others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from
some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not
reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as
the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that
they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without
undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or
absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The
first was, that as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more
rapid their descent; the second, that, between two masses of equal
extent, the one spherical, and the other of <i>any other shape</i>, the
superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third, that,
between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of
any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my
escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old
schoolmaster of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use
of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me--although I
have forgotten the explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the
natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments, and showed
me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more
resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty,
than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.</p>
<p>"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in
enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to
account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something
like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of
these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes
upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed
to have moved but little from their original station.</p>
<p>"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself
securely to the water-cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from
the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my
brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came
near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I
was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my
design--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head
despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ringbolt. It
was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so,
with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to
the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and
precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's
hesitation.</p>
<p>"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is
myself who now tell you this tale--as you see that I <i>did</i>
escape--and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this
escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have
farther to say-I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might
have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when,
having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four
wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with
it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below.
The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half
the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I
leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of
the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently
less and less steep. The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less
and less violent. By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and
the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the
winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the
west, when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of
the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the
Moskoe-str&ouml;m <i>had been.</i> It was the hour of the slack, but the
sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.
I was borne violently into the channel of the Str&ouml;m, and in a few
minutes was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen.
A boat picked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger
was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me
on board were my old mates and daily companions, but they knew me no
more than they would have known a traveler from the spirit-land. My
hair, which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see
it now. They say, too, that the whole expression of my countenance had
changed. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it to
you--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the
merry fishermen of Lofoden."<br>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a
midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over many a quaint and curious volume of
forgotten lore,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there
came a tapping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
chamber door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my
chamber door:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
this and nothing more."</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, distinctly I
remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost
upon the floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had
sought to borrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for
the lost Lenore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels
name Lenore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nameless
here for evermore.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silken
sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors
never felt before;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that now, to still the beating of my heart,
I stood repeating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my
chamber door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some late visitor entreating entrance at my
chamber door:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
it is and nothing more."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently my soul
grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your
forgiveness I implore;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently
you came rapping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my
chamber door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I
opened wide the door:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness
there and nothing more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep into that
darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared
to dream before;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness
gave no token,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the only word there spoken was the
whispered word, "Lenore?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the
word, "Lenore":<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely
this and nothing more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back into the
chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder
than before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at
my window lattice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this
mystery explore;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery
explore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis
the wind and nothing more."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open here I flung
the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly
days of yore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute
stopped or stayed he;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above
my chamber door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my
chamber door:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched,
and sat, and nothing more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this ebony
bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the grave and stern decorum of the
countenance it wore,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I
said, "art sure no craven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from
the Nightly shore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's
Plutonian shore!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much I marveled
this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though its answer little meaning--little
relevancy bore;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we cannot help agreeing that no living
human being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his
chamber door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above
his chamber door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
such name as "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Raven,
sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one word, as if his soul in that one word
he did outpour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather
then he fluttered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I scarcely more than muttered,--"Other
friends have flown before;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes
have flown before."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
the bird said, "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startled at the
stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its
only stock and store,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful
Disaster<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed fast and followed faster till his
songs one burden bore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy
burden bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
'Never--nevermore.'"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Raven
still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of
bird and bust and door;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself
to linking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous
bird of 'yore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and
ominous bird of yore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant
in croaking "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I sat
engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my
bosom's core;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and more I sat divining, with my head at
ease reclining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cushion's velvet lining that the
lamp-light gloated o'er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whose velvet violet lining with the
lamp-light gloating o'er<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
shall press,' ah, nevermore!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, methought,
the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on
the tufted floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee by
these angels he hath sent thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories
of Lenore!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget
this lost Lenore!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophet!" said
I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed
thee here ashore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land
enchanted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly,
I implore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there, is there balm in Gilead?--tell
me--tell me, I implore!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophet!" said
I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God
we both adore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the
distant Aidenn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels
name Lenore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels
name Lenore!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be that word our
sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's
Plutonian shore!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy
soul hath spoken!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust
above my door!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy
form from off my door!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth
the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Raven,
never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my
chamber door;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's
that is dreaming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws
his shadow on the floor:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my soul from out that shadow that lies
floating on the floor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall
be lifted--nevermore!<br>

WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</span></p>
<p>In "The Courtship of Miles Standish" Longfellow has made us
acquainted with his ancestors, John Alden and Priscilla Mullens,
passengers of the Mayflower. Of such ancestry Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
was born in Portland, Maine, February 27, 1807. His birthplace was at
that time a beautiful and busy town, a forest city with miles of sea
beach and a port where merchant vessels from the West Indies exchanged
sugar and rum for the products of the forest and the fisheries of Maine.</p>
<p>We are told that he was a boy "true, high-minded and noble";
"active, eager, often impatient"; "handsome in appearance" and the
"sunlight of the home." His conduct at school was "very correct and
amiable"--he read much and was always studious and thoughtful. The first
book which fascinated his imagination was Irving's "Sketch-Book." Indeed
there is a resemblance between the gentle Irving and the gentle
Longfellow which is expressed in the prose of one and the poetry of the
other.</p>
<p>Longfellow's education was obtained in Portland and at Bowdoin
College, Brunswick, Maine, where he had for classmates several youths
who afterward became famous, Nathaniel Hawthorne, J. S. C. Abbott, and
Franklin Pierce. Upon Longfellow's graduation, the trustees of the
college, having decided to establish a chair of modern languages,
proposed that this young graduate, of scholarly and literary tastes,
should fit himself for this position. Three years, therefore, he spent
in delightful study and travel in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany.
Here was laid the foundation for his scholarship, and, as in Irving on
his first European trip, there was kindled that passion for romantic
lore which followed him through life and which gave color and direction
to much of his work. He mastered the language of each country visited in
a remarkably short time, and many of the choicer poems found in these
languages he has given to us in the English.</p>
<p>After five years at Bowdoin, Longfellow was invited in 1834 to the
chair of modern languages in Harvard College. Again he was given an
opportunity to prepare himself by a year of study abroad. In 1836 he
began his active work at Harvard and took up his residence in the
historic Craigie House, overlooking the Charles River--a house in which
Washington had been quartered for some months when he came to Cambridge
in 1775 to take command of the Continental forces. Longfellow was
thenceforth one of the most prominent members of that group of men
including Sumner, Hawthorne, Agassiz, Lowell, and Holmes, who gave
distinction to the Boston and Cambridge of earlier days.</p>
<p>For twenty years Longfellow filled the professorship of modern
languages at Harvard and was one of the best beloved instructors at the
university. He resigned that he might devote himself to writing and was
succeeded at Harvard by James Russell Lowell.</p>
<p>Though Longfellow wrote in prose and is the author of many shorter
poems, his reputation is mainly based upon his longer poems. Longfellow
was a great admirer of the German poet, Goethe, to whose "Hermann and
Dorothea" we are indebted for much of the form and no doubt some of the
story of Evangeline. The story of Acadie was told first to Hawthorne by
a friend of both authors; but the tale was hardly dark enough to suit
the fancy of Hawthorne, whereas to Longfellow it seemed to have in it
precisely those elements of faith and devotion that make the widest
appeal. In a collection of poems published in 1850 appeared the poem of
Longfellow's highest patriotic reach, the allegory of "The Building of
the Ship." A friend of Lincoln recited this poem to him, and when the
lines of its closing apostrophe to the ship of state were reached, with
tears in his eyes the president said, "It is a great gift to be able to
stir men like that." In his poem, "Hiawatha," Longfellow chose the metre
of the Finnish epic "Kalevala," which is peculiarly suited to the tales
of primitive people. The worthiest and most picturesque traditions of
the American Indian are woven into a connected story whose charm is
greatly heightened by the novel melody of the verse.</p>
<p>In 1861 the happiness of Longfellow's home life was broken by the
death of his wife, who was fatally burned. He turned from this sorrow
and the anxieties of the Civil War to the more mechanical work of
writing tales and making translations. The "Tales of a Wayside Inn"
appeared in 1863, and seven years later he published his translation of
Dante's "Divine Comedy."</p>
<p>On Longfellow's seventy-second birthday the children of Cambridge
presented him with a chair made from the wood of the "Village
Blacksmith's" chestnut tree. He died March 24, 1882, aged seventy-five.
In 1884 a bust of him was placed in the Poets' Corner of Westminster
Abbey--England's gracious tribute to the renown of America's best loved
poet.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the forest primeval. The murmuring
pines and the hemlocks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearded with moss, and in garments green,
indistinct in the twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and
prophetic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest
on their bosoms.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced
neighboring ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the
wail of the forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the forest primeval; but where are
the hearts that beneath it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the
woodland the voice of the huntsman?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of
Acadian farmers,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men whose lives glided on like rivers that
water the woodlands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an
image of heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers
forever departed!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty
blasts of October<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle
them far o'er the ocean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful
village of Grand-Pr&eacute;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and
endures, and is patient,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of
woman's devotion,<br>

the pines of the forest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the
happy.</p>
<p><br>
PART THE FIRST.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Acadian land, on the shores of the
Basin of Minas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distant, secluded, still, the little village of
Grand-Pr&eacute;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows
stretched to the eastward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving the village its name, and pasture to
flocks without number.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised
with labor incessant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated
seasons the floodgates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will
o'er the meadows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West and south there were fields of flax, and
orchards and cornfields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and
away to the northward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft
on the mountains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from
the mighty Atlantic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from
their station descended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the
Acadian village.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly built were the houses, with frames of
oak and of chestnut,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the
reign of the Henries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows;
and gables projecting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the basement below protected and shaded
the doorway.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when
brightly the sunset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted the village street, and gilded the
vanes on the chimneys,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and
in kirtles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs
spinning the golden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy
shuttles within doors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels
and the songs of the maidens.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly down the street came the parish
priest, and the children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused in their play to kiss the hand he
extended to bless them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverend walked he among them; and up rose
matrons and maidens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailing his slow approach with words of
affectionate welcome.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the laborers home from the field, and
serenely the sun sank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon
from the belfry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs
of the village<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of
incense ascending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace
and contentment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus dwelt together in love these simple
Acadian farmers,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were
they free from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy,
the vice of republics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither locks had they to their doors, nor,
bars to their windows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their dwellings were open as day and the
hearts of the owners;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the richest was poor, and the poorest
lived in abundance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer
the Basin of Minas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer
of Grand-Pr&eacute;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt on his goodly acres; and with him,
directing his household,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the
pride of the village.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalworth and stately in form was the man of
seventy winters;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered
with snow-flakes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White as the snow were his locks, and his
cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she to behold, that maiden of
seventeen summers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on
the thorn by the wayside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the
brown shade of her tresses!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that
feed in the meadows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the harvest heat she bore to the
reapers at noontide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth
was the maiden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the
bell from its turret<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the
priest with his hyssop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters
blessings upon them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long street she passed, with her
chaplet of beads and her missal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue,
and the ear-rings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought in the olden time from France, and
since, as an heir-loom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handed down from mother to child, through long
generations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a celestial brightness--a more ethereal
beauty--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone on her face and encircled her form, when,
after confession,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward serenely she walked with God's
benediction upon her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing
of exquisite music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the
house of the farmer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea;
and a shady<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine
wreathing around it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudely carved was the porch, with seats
beneath; and a footpath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in
the meadow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by
a penthouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the traveler sees in regions remote by
the roadside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed
image of Mary.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the
well with its moss-grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a
trough for the horses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shielding the house from storms, on the north,
were the barns and the farm-yard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the
antique ploughs and the harrows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the folds for the sheep; and there,
in his feathered seraglio,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the
cock, with the self-same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice that in ages of old had startled the
penitent Peter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a
village. In each one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch;
and a staircase,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the
odorous cornloft.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and
innocent inmates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring ever of love; while above in the
variant breezes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang
of mutation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, at peace with God and the world, the
farmer of Grand-Pr&eacute;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline
governed his house-hold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and
opened his missal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his
deepest devotion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy was he who might touch her hand or the
hem of her garment!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness
befriended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound
of her foot-steps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or
the knocker of iron;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of
the village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance
as he whispered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of
the music.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But among all who came young Gabriel only was
welcome;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the
blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was a mighty man in the village, and
honored of all men;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For since the birth of time, throughout all
ages and nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the craft of the smith been held in repute
by the people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basil was Benedict's friend--Their children
from earliest child-hood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew up together as brother and sister; and
Father Felician,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had
taught them their letters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the
church and the plain-song.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the hymn was sung, and the daily
lesson completed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil
the blacksmith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There at the door they stood, with wondering
eyes to behold him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse
as a plaything,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him
the tire of the cartwheel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a
circle of cinders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft on autumnal eyes, when without in the
gathering darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through
every cranny and crevice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm by the forge within they watched the
laboring bellows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as its panting ceased, and the sparks
expired in the ashes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going
into the chapel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop
of the eagle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the hillside bounding, they glided away
o'er the meadow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous
nests on the rafters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone,
which the swallow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the
sight of its fledglings;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest
of the swallow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus passed a few swift years, and they no
longer were children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the
face of the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened
thought into action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes
of a woman.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunshine of Saint Eulalie" was she called; for
that was the sunshine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as the farmers believed, would load
their orchards with apples;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She too would bring to her husband's house
delight and abundance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of
children.</p>
<p><br>
II.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder
and longer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion
enters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air,
from the icebound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate northern bays to the shores of
tropical islands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the
winds of September<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of
old with the angel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the signs foretold a winter long and
inclement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had
hoarded their honey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian
hunters asserted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur
of the foxes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed
that beautiful season,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer
of All-Saints!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical
light; and the landscape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of
childhood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the
restless heart of the ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in
harmony blended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of children at play, the crowing of
cocks in the farmyards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing
of pigeons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were subdued and low as the murmurs of
love, and the great sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with the eye of love through the golden
vapors around him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While arrayed in its robes of russet and
scarlet and yellow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with the sheen of the dew, each
glittering tree of the forest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned
with mantles and jewels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now recommenced the reign of rest and
affection and stillness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day with its burden and heat had departed, and
twilight descending<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought back the evening star to the sky, and
the herds to the homestead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pawing the ground they came, and resting their
necks on each other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with their nostrils distended inhaling the
freshness of evening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's
beautiful heifer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon
that waved from her collar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of
human affection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the shepherd back with his bleating
flocks from the seaside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them
followed the watch-dog,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient, full of importance, and grand in the
pride of his instinct,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking from side to side with a lordly air,
and superbly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the
stragglers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd
slept; their protector,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When from the forest at night, through the
starry silence, the wolves howled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains
from the marshes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with
its odor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their
manes and their fetlocks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and
ponderous saddles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with
tassels of crimson<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy
with blossoms.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded
their udders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in
regular cadence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets
descended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were
heard in the farmyard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into
stillness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the
valves of the barn doors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battled the wooden bars, and all for a season
was silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed
fireplace, idly the farmer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the
flames and the smoke-wreaths<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggled together like foes in a burning city.
Behind him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodding and mocking along the wall with
gestures fantastic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away
into darkness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of
his arm-chair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed in the nickering light, and the pewter
plates on the dresser<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of
armies the sunshine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols
of Christmas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers
before him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in their Norman orchards and bright
Burgundian vineyards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close at her father's side was the gentle
Evangeline seated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spinning flax for the loom that stood in the
corner behind her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was
its diligent shuttle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like
the drone of a bagpipe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed the old man's song, and united the
fragments together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a church, when the chant of the choir at
intervals ceases,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of
the priest at the altar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in each pause of the song, with measured
motion the clock clicked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus as they sat, there were footsteps
heard, and, suddenly lifted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung
back on its hinges.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was
Basil the blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who
was with him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome!" the farmer exclaimed, as their
footsteps paused on the threshold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy
place on the settle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by the chimney-side, which is always
empty without thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the
box of tobacco;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never so much thyself art thou as when, through
the curling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke of the pipe or the forge, thy friendly
and jovial face gleams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and red as the harvest moon through the
mist of the marshes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a smile of content, thus answered
Basil the blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the
fireside:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy
jest and thy ballad!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others
are filled with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin
before them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst
packed up a horseshoe."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that
Evangeline brought him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he
slowly continued:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days now are passed since the English
ships at their anchors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their
cannon pointed against us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What their design may be is unknown; but all
are commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow to meet in the church, where his
Majesty's mandate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in
the meantime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the
people."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then made answer the farmer:--"Perhaps some
friendlier purpose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings these ships to our shores.
Perhaps the harvests in England<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the untimely rains or untimelier heat have
been blighted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from our bursting barns they would feed
their cattle and children."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so thinketh the folk in the village," said
warmly the blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking his head as in doubt; then, heaving a
sigh, he continued:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau
S&eacute;jour, nor Port Royal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk
on its outskirts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of
tomorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arms have been taken from us, and warlike
weapons of all kinds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and
the scythe of the mower."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a pleasant smile made answer the
jovial farmer:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our
flocks and our cornfields,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by
the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than were our fathers in forts, besieged by the
enemy's cannon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear no evil, my friend, and tonight may no
shadow of sorrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the
night of the contract.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built are the house and the barn. The merry
lads of the village<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly have built them and well; and,
breaking the glebe round about them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the barn with hay, and the house with
food for a twelvemonth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben&eacute; Leblanc will be here anon, with his
papers and inkhorn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the
joy of our children?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As apart by the window she stood, with her hand
in her lover's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her
father had spoken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as they died on his lips, the worthy
notary entered.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the
surf of the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of
the notary public;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of
the maize, hung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and
glasses with horn bows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom
supernal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of twenty children was he, and more than
a hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's children rode on his knee, and heard
his great watch tick.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four long years in the times of the war had he
languished a captive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffering much in an old French fort as the
friend of the English.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, though warier grown, without all guile or
suspicion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple,
and childlike.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was beloved by all, and most of all by the
children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the
forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the goblin that came in the night to
water the horses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the white L&eacute;tiche, the ghost of a
child who unchristened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the
chambers of children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the
stable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up
in a nutshell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the marvelous powers of four-leaved
clover and horseshoes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of
the village.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up rose from his seat by the fireside
Basil the blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly
extending his right hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father Leblanc," he exclaimed, "thou hast
heard the talk in the village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, perchance, canst tell us some news of
these ships and their errand."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with modest demeanor made answer the
notary public,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am
never the wiser;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what their errand may be I know not better
than others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil
intention<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why
then molest us?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God's name!" shouted the hasty and somewhat
irascible blacksmith;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must we in all things look for the how, and
the why, and the wherefore?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily injustice is done, and might is the right
of the strongest!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, without heeding his warmth, continued the
notary public,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally
justice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that
often consoled me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When as a captive I lay in the old French fort
at Port Royal."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the old man's favorite tale, and he
loved to repeat it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his neighbors complained that any
injustice was done them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once in an ancient city, whose name I no
longer remember,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of
Justice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood in the public square, upholding the
scales in its left hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in its right a sword, as an emblem that
justice presided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and
homes of the people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the birds had built their nests in the
scales of the balance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the
sunshine above them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the course of time the laws of the land
were corrupted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might took the place of right, and the weak
were oppressed, and the mighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a
nobleman's palace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a necklace of pearls was lost, and ere
long a suspicion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the
household.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, after form of trial condemned to die on
the scaffold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiently met her doom at the foot of the
statue of Justice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit
ascended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts
of the thunder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath
from its left hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the pavement below the clattering
scales of the balance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of
a magpie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of
pearls was inwoven."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was
ended, the blacksmith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood like a man who fain would speak, but
findeth no language;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his thoughts were congealed into lines on
his face, as the vapors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes
in the winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline lighted the Brazen lamp on
the table,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard
with home-brewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength
in the village of Grand-Pr&eacute;;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from his pocket the notary drew his
papers and inkhorn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age
of the parties,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of
sheep and in cattle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well
were completed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great seal of the law was set like a
sun on the margin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw
on the table<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces
of silver;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the notary rising, and blessing the bride
and the bridegroom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to
their welfare.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiping the foam from, his lip, he solemnly
bowed and departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in silence the others sat and mused by
the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out
of its corner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention
the old men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful
manoeuvre,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was
made in the king-row.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a
window's embrasure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the lovers and whispered together,
beholding the moon rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the
meadows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of
heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots
of the angels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell
from the belfry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew,
and straightway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the guests and departed; and silence
reigned in the household.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on
the door-step<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled
it with gladness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully then were covered the embers that
glowed on the hearth-stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of
the farmer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon with a soundless step the foot of
Evangeline followed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the
darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face
of the maiden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent she passed through the hall, and entered
the door of her chamber.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of
white, and its clothes-press<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were
carefully folded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of
Evangeline woven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the precious dower she would bring to
her husband in marriage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of
her skill as a house-wife.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow
and radiant moonlight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed through the windows, and lighted the
room, till the heart of the maiden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled and obeyed its power, like the
tremulous tides of the ocean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as
she stood with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of
her chamber!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little she dreamed that below, among the trees
of the orchard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of
her lamp and her shadow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a
feeling of sadness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of
clouds in the moonlight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted across the floor and darkened the room
for a moment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she gazed from the window, she saw
serenely the moon pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star
follow her footsteps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered
with Hagar.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the
village of Grand-Pr&eacute;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the
Basin of Minas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the ships, with their wavering shadows,
were riding at anchor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life had long been astir in the village, and
clamorous labor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden
gates of the morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now from the country around, from the farms and
neighboring hamlets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came in their holiday dresses the blithe
Acadian peasants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from
the young folk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the bright air brighter, as up from the
numerous meadows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no path could be seen but the track of
wheels in the greensward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group after group appeared, and joined, or
passed on the highway.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of
labor were silenced.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronged were the streets with people; and
noisy groups at the house-doors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and
gossiped together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed
and feasted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For with this simple people, who lived like
brothers together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things were held in common, and what one
had was another's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed
more abundant:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Evangeline stood among the guests of her
father;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright was her face with smiles, and words of
welcome and gladness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the
cup as she gave it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the open sky, in the odorous air of
the orchard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending with golden fruit, was spread the feast
of betrothal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the shade of the porch were the priest
and the notary seated;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the
blacksmith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far withdrawn from these, by the
cider-press and the beehives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest
of hearts and of waistcoats.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow and light from the leaves alternately
played on his snow-white<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly
face of the fiddler<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are
blown from the embers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of
his fiddle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres,</i> and <i>Le
Carillon de Dunkerque,</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anon with his wooden, shoes beat time to
the music.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the
dizzying dances<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the orchard-trees and down the path to
the meadows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old folk and young together, and children
mingled among them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline,
Benedict's daughter!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of
the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the morning away. And lo! with a
summons sonorous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the
meadows a drum beat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronged ere long was the church with men.
Without, in the churchyard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and
hung on the headstones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh
from the forest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the guard from the ships, and
marching proudly among them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the sacred portal. With loud and
dissonant clangor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from
ceiling and casement,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous
portal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the
will of the soldiers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then uprose their commander, and spake from the
steps of the altar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the
royal commission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are convened this day," he said, "by his
Majesty's orders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement and kind has he been; but how you have
answered his kindness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make
and my temper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painful the task is I do, which to you I know
must be grievous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will
of our monarch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and
cattle of all kinds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeited be to the crown; and that you
yourselves from this province<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be transported to other lands. God grant you
may dwell there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and
peaceable people!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners now I declare you, for such is his
Majesty's pleasure!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, when the air is serene in the sultry
solstice of summer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling
of the hailstones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats down the farmer's corn in the field, and
shatters his windows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with
thatch from the house-roofs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break
their enclosures;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the hearts of the people descended the
words of the speaker.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent a moment they stood in speechless
wonder, and then rose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and
anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to
the door-way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and
fierce imprecations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang through the house of prayer; and high o'er
the heads of the others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of
Basil the blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the
billows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushed was his face and distorted with
passion; and wildly he shouted,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Down with the tyrants of England! we never
have sworn them allegiance!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on
our homes and our harvests!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More he fain would have said, but the merciless
hand of a soldier<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down
to the pavement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the strife and tumult of
angry contention,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father
Felician<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the
steps of the altar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he
awed into silence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to
his people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents
measured and mournful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum,
distinctly the clock strikes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this that ye do, my children? what
madness has seized you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty years of my life have I labored among
you, and taught you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one
another!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and
prayers and privations?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love
and forgiveness?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and
would you profane it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing
with hatred?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! where the crucified Christ from His cross
is gazing upon you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and
holy compassion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer,
'O Father, forgive them!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the
wicked assail us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father,
forgive them!'"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the
hearts of his people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the
passionate outbreak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they repeated his prayer, and said, "O
Father, forgive them!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the evening service. The tapers
gleamed from the altar;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest,
and the people responded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with their lips alone, but their hearts;
and the Ave Maria<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their
souls, with devotion translated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah
ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile had spread in the village the
tidings of ill, and on all sides<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered, wailing, from house to house the
women and children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long at her father's door Evangeline stood,
with her right hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the
sun, that, descending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted the village street with mysterious
splendor and roofed each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and
emblazoned its windows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long within had been spread the snow-white
cloth on the table;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey
fragrant with wild flowers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese
fresh brought from the dairy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the head of the board the great
arm-chair of the farmer:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door,
as the sunset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad
ambrosial meadows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had
fallen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the fields of her soul a fragrance
celestial ascended,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and
forgiveness, and patience!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, all forgetful of self, she wandered into
the village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheering with looks and words the disconsolate
hearts of the women,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er the darkening fields with lingering
steps they departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged by their household cares, and the weary
feet of their children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down sank the great red sun, and in golden,
glimmering vapors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet
descending from Sinai.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetly over the village the bell of the
Angelus sounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church
Evangeline lingered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was silent within; and in vain at the door
and the windows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood she, and listened and looked, until,
overcome by emotion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel!" cried she aloud with tremulous
voice; but no answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from the graves of the dead, nor the
gloomier grave of the living.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless
house of her father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board
stood the supper untasted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with
phantoms of terror.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the
floor of her chamber.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead of the night she heard the
whispering rain fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud on the withered leaves of the
sycamore-tree by the window.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of
the echoing thunder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told her that God was in heaven, and governed
the world He created!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she remembered the tale she had heard of
the justice of Heaven;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed was her troubled soul, and she
peacefully slumbered till morning.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the
fifth day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids
of the farm-house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and
mournful procession,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the
Acadian women,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving in ponderous wains their household
goods to the sea-shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on
their dwellings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they were shut from sight by the winding
road and the wood-land.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close at their sides their children ran, and
urged on the oxen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in their little hands they clasped some
fragments of playthings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried;
and there on the sea-beach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled in confusion lay the household goods of
the peasants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long between the shore and the ships
did the boats ply;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long the wains came laboring down from
the village.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to
his setting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoing far o'er the fields came the roll of
drums from the churchyard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither the women and children thronged. On a
sudden the church-doors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching
in gloomy procession<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient,
Acadian farmers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their
homes and their country,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are
weary and wayworn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with songs on their lips the Acadian
peasants descended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from the church to the shore, amid their
wives and their daughters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost the young men came; and, raising
together their voices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang they with tremulous lips a chant of the
Catholic Missions:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible
fountain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill our hearts this day with strength and
submission and patience!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the old men, as they marched, and the
women that stood by the wayside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in
the sunshine above them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of
spirits departed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited
in silence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour
of affliction,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly and sadly waited, until the procession
approached her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with
emotion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears then rilled her eyes, and, eagerly
running to meet him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his
shoulder, and whispered,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one
another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever
mischances may happen!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly
paused, for her father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw she, slowly advancing. Alas! how changed
was his aspect!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire
from his eye, and his footstep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavier seemed with the weight of the weary
heart in his bosom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his
neck and embraced him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words of endearment where words of
comfort availed not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that
mournful procession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and
stir of embarking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the
confusion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wives were torn from their husbands, and
mothers, too late, saw their children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left on the land, extending their arms, with
wildest entreaties.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel
carried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood
with her father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half the task was not done when the sun went
down, and the twilight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the
refluent ocean'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled away from the shore, and left the line of
the sand-beach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and
the slippery seaweed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther back in the midst of the household
goods and the wagons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a
battle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All escape cut off by the sea, and the
sentinels near them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay encamped for the night the houseless
Acadian farmers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to its nethermost caves retreated the
bellowing ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles,
and leaving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats
of the sailors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as the night descended, the herds
returned from their pastures;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of
milk from their udders;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known
bars of the farm-yard,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the
hand of the milkmaid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence reigned in the streets; from the church
no Angelus sounded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no
lights from the windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the shores meanwhile the evening
fires had been kindled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands
from wrecks in the tempest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces
were gathered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the
crying of children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to
hearth in his parish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and
blessing and cheering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate
seashore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he approached the place where Evangeline
sat with her father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the flickering light beheld the face of
the old man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either
thought or emotion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as the face of a clock from which the
hands have been taken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly Evangeline strove with words and
caresses to cheer him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he
looked not, he spake not,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the
flickering fire-light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Benedicite!"</i> murmured the priest, in
tones of compassion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More he fain would have said, but his heart was
full, and his accents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of
a child on a threshold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful
presence of sorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the
head of the maiden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising his eyes full of tears to the silent
stars that above them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs
and sorrows of mortals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sat he down at her side, and they wept
together in silence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in
autumn the blood-red<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and
o'er the horizon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon
mountain, and meadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling
huge shadows together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the
roofs of the village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships
that lay in the roadstead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of
flame were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like
the quivering hands of a martyr.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the
burning thatch, and, uplifting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled them aloft through the air, at once
from, a hundred house-tops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame
intermingled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things beheld in dismay the crowd on
the shore and on shipboard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless at first they stood, then cried
aloud in their anguish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We shall behold no more our homes in the
village of Grand-Pr&eacute;!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the
farmyards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the
lowing of cattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of
dogs interrupted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles
the sleeping encampments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the western prairies of forests that
skirt the Nebraska,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with
the speed of the whirlwind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush
to the river.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the sound that arose on the night, as
the herds and the horses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke through their folds and fences, and madly
rushed o'er the meadows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless,
the priest and the maiden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and
widened before them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they turned at length to speak to their
silent companion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched
abroad on the seashore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless lay his form, from which the soul
had departed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head,
and the maiden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in
her terror.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head
on his bosom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long night she lay in deep,
oblivious slumber;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a
multitude near her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces of friends she beheld, that were
mournfully gazing upon her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest
compassion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the blaze of the burning village
illumined the landscape,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the
faces around her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like the day of doom it seemed to her
wavering senses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to
the people,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us bury him here by the sea. When a
happier season<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings us again to our homes from the unknown
land of our exile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in
the churchyard."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the words of the priest. And there in
haste by the sea-side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the glare of the burning village for
funeral torches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without bell or book, they buried the
farmer of Grand-Pr&eacute;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the voice of the priest repeated the
service of sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! with, a mournful sound like the voice of a
vast congregation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar
with the dirges.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas the returning tide, that afar from the
waste of the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first dawn of the day, came heaving
and hurrying landward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then recommenced once more the stir and noise
of embarking;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the ebb of that tide the ships sailed
out of the harbor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and
the village in ruins.</p>
<p>PART THE SECOND.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Many a weary year had passed since the burning of
Grand-Pr&eacute;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the falling tide the freighted vessels
departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing a nation, with all its household goods,
into exile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exile without an end, and without an example in
story.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians
landed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when
the wind from the northeast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the
Banks of Newfoundland.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered
from city to city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cold lakes of the North to sultry
Southern savannas,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands
where the Father of Waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them
down to the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones
of the mammoth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends they sought and homes; and many,
despairing, heart-broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a
friend nor a fireside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written their history stands on tablets of
stone in the churchyards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long among them was seen a maiden who waited
and wandered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently
suffering all things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her
extended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life,
with its pathway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed
and suffered before her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead
and abandoned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert
is marked by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach
in the sunshine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something there was in her life incomplete,
imperfect, unfinished;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a morning of June, with all its music and
sunshine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly
descended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the east again, from whence it late had
arisen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by
the fever within her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and
thirst of the spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would commence again her endless search and
endeavor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on
the crosses and tombstones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that
perhaps in its bosom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already at rest, and she longed to
slumber beside him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate
whisper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with its airy hand to, point and beckon
her forward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her
beloved and known him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was long ago, in some far-off place or
forgotten.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" said they; "Oh, yes! we
have seen him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have
gone to the prairies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Coureurs-des-bois</i> are they, and famous
hunters and trappers."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" said others; "Oh; yes! we
have seen him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a <i>voyageur</i> in the lowlands of
Louisiana."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would they say, "Dear child! why dream and
wait for him longer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel?
others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits
as loyal?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who
has loved thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand
and be happy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art too fair to be left to braid St.
Catherine's tresses."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but
sadly, "I cannot!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither my heart has gone, there follows my
hand, and not elsewhere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the heart goes before, like a lamp,
and illumines the pathway,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things are made clear, that else lie
hidden in darkness."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon the priest, her friend and father
confessor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, with a smile, "O daughter! thy God thus
speaketh within thee!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk not of wasted affection, affection never
was wasted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it enrich not the heart of another, its
waters, returning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to their springs, like the rain, shall
fill them full of refreshment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which the fountain sends forth returns
again to the fountain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience; accomplish thy labor; accomplish thy
work of affection!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient
endurance is godlike.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till
the heart is made godlike,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered
more worthy of heaven!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline
labored and waited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge
of the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with its sound there was mingled a voice
that whispered, "Despair not!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did that poor soul wander in want and
cheerless discomfort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and
thorns of existence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's
footsteps;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not through each devious path, each changeful
year of existence;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a traveler follows a streamlet's course
through the valley:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from its margin at times, and seeing the
gleam of its water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there, in some open space, and at
intervals only;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drawing nearer its bank, through sylvan
glooms that conceal it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he behold it not, he can hear its
continuous murmur;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy, at length, if he find a spot where it
reaches an outlet.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the month of May. Far down the
Beautiful River,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the
Wabash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the golden stream of the broad and swift
Mississippi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by
Acadian boatmen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were,
from the shipwrecked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating
together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a
common misfortune;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women and children, who, guided by hope
or by hearsay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought for their kith and their kin among the
few-acred farmers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair
Opelousas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the
Father Felician<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness
sombre with forests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day they glided adown the turbulent
river;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night, by their blazing fires,
encamped on its borders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through rushing chutes, among green
islands, where plumelike<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they
swept with the current,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery
sandbars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves
of their margin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of
pelicans waded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level the landscape grew, and along the shores
of the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of
luxuriant gardens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the houses of planters, with negro cabins
and dove-cots.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were approaching the region where reigns
perpetual summer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of
orange and citron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to
the eastward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, too, swerved from their course; and,
entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and
devious waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, like a network of steel, extended in
every direction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over their heads the towering and tenebrous
boughs of the cypress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in
midair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved like banners that hang on the walls of
ancient cathedrals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken,
save by the herons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees
returning at sunset,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with
demoniac laughter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and
gleamed on the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar
sustaining the arches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down through whose broken vaults it fell as
through chinks in a ruin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all
things around them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of
wonder and sadness,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange forebodings of ill, unseen, and that
cannot be compassed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf
of the prairies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in advance are closed the leaves of the
shrinking mimosa,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad
forebodings of evil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of
doom has attained it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a
vision, that faintly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on
through the moonlight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the thought of her brain that assumed
the shape of a phantom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel
wandered before her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every stroke of the oar now brought him
nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in his place, at the prow of the boat,
rose one of the oarsmen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as a signal sound, if others like them
peradventure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams,
blew a blast on his bugle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors
leafy the blast rang,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues
to the forest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soundless above them the banners of moss just
stirred to the music.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the
distance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the watery floor, and beneath the
reverberant branches;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a voice replied; no answer came from
the darkness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of
pain was the silence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed
through the midnight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian
boat-songs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian
rivers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the night were heard the mysterious
sounds of the desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off,--indistinct,--as of wave or wind in
the forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar
of the grim alligator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ere another noon they emerged from
those shades; and before them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the
Atchafalaya.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight
undulations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in
beauty, the lotus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the
boatmen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint was the air with the odorous breath of
magnolia blossoms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the heat of noon; and numberless
sylvan islands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming
hedges of roses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to whose shores they glided along, invited
to slumber.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars
were suspended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew
by the margin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safely their boat was moored; and scattered
about on the greensward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired with their midnight toil, the weary
travelers slumbered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them vast and high extended the cope of a
cedar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging from its great arms, the
trumpet-flower and the grapevine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the
ladder of Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending,
descending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from
blossom to blossom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she
slumbered beneath it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of
an opening heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of
regions celestial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer and ever nearer, among the numberless
islands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er
the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of
hunters and trappers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward its prow was turned, to the land of
the bison and beaver.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the helm sat a youth, with countenance
thoughtful and careworn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow,
and a sadness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat beyond his years on his face was
legibly written.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting,
unhappy and restless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self
and of sorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee
of the island,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen
of palmettos;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that they saw not the boat, where it lay
concealed in the willows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and
unseen, were the sleepers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel of God was there none to awaken the
slumbering maiden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a
cloud on the prairie.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound of their oars on the tholes had
died in the distance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and
the maiden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, "O
Father Felician!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel
wanders.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague
superstition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth
to my spirit?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a blush, she added, "Alas for my
credulous fancy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto ears like thine such words as these have
no meaning."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled
as he answered,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they
to me without meaning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling is deep and still; and the word that
floats on the surface<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the
anchor is hidden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the
world calls illusions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to
the southward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks of the T&ecirc;che, are the towns
of St. Maur and St. Martin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the long-wandering bride shall be given
again to her bridegroom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the long-absent pastor regain his flock
and his sheepfold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and
forests of fruit-trees;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the
bluest of heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending above, and resting its dome on the
walls of the forest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who dwell there have named it the Eden of
Louisiana."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with these words of cheer they arose and
continued their journey.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the evening came. The sun from the
western horizon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er
the landscape;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and
forest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and
mingled together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges
of silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on
the motionless water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was Evangeline's heart with
inexpressible sweetness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountain
of feeling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and
waters around her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from a neighboring thicket the
mocking-bird, wildest of singers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er
the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook from his little throat such floods of
delirious music,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the whole air and the woods and the waves
seemed silent to listen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then
soaring to madness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of
frenzied Bacchantes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low
lamentation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, having gathered them all, he flung them
abroad in derision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through
the tree-tops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal
shower on the branches.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a prelude as this, and hearts that
throbbed with emotion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly they entered the T&ecirc;che, where it
flows through the green Opelousas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, through the amber air, above the crest of
the woodland,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the column of smoke that arose from a
neighboring dwelling;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant
lowing of cattle.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by
oaks from whose branches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic
mistletoe flaunted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the Druids cut down with golden
hatchets at Yule-tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood, secluded and still, the house of the
herdsman. A garden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant
blossoms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air with fragrance. The house
itself was of timbers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully
fitted together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large and low was the roof; and on slender
columns supported,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and
spacious veranda,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended
around it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each end of the house, amid the flowers of
the garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's
perpetual symbol,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenes of endless wooing, and endless
contentions of rivals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of
shadow and sunshine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house
itself was in shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly
expanding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the evening air, a thin blue column of
smoke rose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rear of the house, from the garden gate,
ran a pathway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the great groves of oak to the skirts
of the limitless prairie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly
descending.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in his track of light, like ships with
shadowy canvas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless
calm in the tropics,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage
of grapevines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where the woodlands met the flowery
surf of the prairie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and
stirrups,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet
of deerskin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad and brown was the face that from under
the Spanish sombrero<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly
look of its master.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about him were numberless herds of kine
that were grazing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the
vapory freshness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That uprose from the river, and spread itself
over the landscape.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side,
and expanding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast,
that resounded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly and sweet and far, through the still
damp air of the evening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns
of the cattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse
currents of ocean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing
rushed o'er the prairie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in
the distance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as the herdsman turned to the house,
through the gate of the garden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden
advancing to meet him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in
amazement, and forward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of
wonder;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they beheld his face, they recognized
Basil the blacksmith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to
the garden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in an arbor of roses with endless
question and answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed
their friendly embraces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting
silent and thoughtful.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark
doubts' and misgivings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil,
somewhat embarrassed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the silence and said, "If you came by the
Atchafalaya,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's
boat on the bayous?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a
shade passed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a
tremulous accent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gone? is Gabriel gone?" and, concealing her
face on his shoulder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she
wept and lamented.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the good Basil said,--and his voice grew
blithe as he said it,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day
he departed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds
and my horses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody and restless grown, and tired and
troubled, his spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet
existence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful
ever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his
troubles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He at length had become so tedious to men and
to maidens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought
me, and sent him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with
the Spaniards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the
Ozark Mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers
trapping the beaver.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the
fugitive lover;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the
streams are against him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew
of the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will follow him fast, and bring him back to
his prison."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then glad voices were heard, and up from the
banks of the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael
the fiddler.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long under Basil's roof had he lived, like a
god on Olympus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no other care than dispensing music to
mortals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far renowned was he for his silver locks and
his fiddle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live Michael," they cried, "our brave
Acadian minstrel!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession;
and straightway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Felician advanced with Evangeline,
greeting the old man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while
Basil, enraptured,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions
and gossips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers
and daughters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much they marveled to see the wealth of the
ci-devant blacksmith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his domains and his herds, and his
patriarchal demeanor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much they marveled to hear his tales of the
soil and the climate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the prairies, whose numberless herds
were his who would take them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one thought in his heart, that he, too,
would go and do likewise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the
breezy veranda,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the hall of the house, where already
the supper of Basil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited his late return; and they rested and
feasted together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness
descended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was silent without, and, illuming the
landscape with silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars;
but within doors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends
in the glimmering lamplight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his station aloft, at the head of the
table, the herdsman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured forth his heart and his wine together in
endless profusion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet
Natchitoches tobacco,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and
smiled as they listened:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome once more, my friends, who so long
have been friendless and homeless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome once more to a home, that is better
perchance than the old one!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like
the rivers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the
farmer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil,
as a keel through the water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the year round the orange-groves are in
blossom; and grass grows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More in a single night than a whole Canadian
summer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, too, numberless herds run wild and
unclaimed in the prairies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, too, lands may he had for the asking, and
forests of timber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed
into houses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After your houses are built, and your fields
are yellow with harvests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No King George of England shall drive you away
from your homesteads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing
your farms and your cattle."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud
from his nostrils,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his huge, brawny hand came thundering down
on the table,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the guests all started; and Father
Felician, astounded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way
to his nostrils.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were
milder and gayer:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware
of the fever!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is not like that of our cold Acadian
climate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck
in a nutshell!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were voices heard at the door, and
footsteps approaching<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the
breezy Veranda.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the neighboring Creoles and small
Acadian planters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil
the herdsman.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and
neighbors:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who
before were as strangers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends
to each other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country
together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the neighboring hall a strain of music,
proceeding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the accordant strings of Michael's
melodious fiddle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up all further speech. Away, like
children delighted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things forgotten beside, they gave
themselves to the maddening<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and
swayed to the music,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of
fluttering garments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall,
the priest and the herdsman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat, conversing together of past and present
and future;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for
within her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of
the music<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard she the sound of the sea, and an
irrepressible sadness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth
into the garden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall
of the forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon.
On the river<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell here and there through the branches a
tremulous gleam of the moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened
and devious spirit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer and round about her, the manifold
flowers of the garden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured out their souls in odors, that were
their prayers and confessions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the night, as it went its way, like a
silent Carthusian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy
with shadows and night-dews,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the
magical moonlight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable
longings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, through the garden gate, beneath the brown
shade of the oak-trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed she along the path to the edge of the
measureless prairie.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and
fire-flies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming and floating away in mingled and
infinite numbers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in
the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to
marvel and worship,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls
of that temple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a hand had appeared and written upon
them, "Upharsin."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of the maiden, between the stars
and the fire-flies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered alone, and she cried, "O Gabriel! O my
beloved!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot
behold thee?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice
does not reach me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to
the prairie!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the
woodlands around me!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from
labor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast lain, down to rest, and to dream of
me in thy slumbers!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shall these eyes behold, these arms be
folded about thee?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud and sudden and near the note of a
whippoorwill sounded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through
the neighboring thickets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther and farther away it floated and dropped
into silence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patience!" whispered the oaks from oracular
caverns of darkness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded,
"To-morrow!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright rose the sun next day; and all the
flowers of the garden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and
anointed his tresses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the delicious balm that they bore in their
vases of crystal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" said the priest, as he stood at the
shadowy threshold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from
his fasting and famine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when
the bridegroom was coming."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" answered the maiden, and, smiling,
with Basil descended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the rivers brink, where the boatmen
already were waiting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus beginning their journey with morning, and
sunshine, and gladness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was
speeding before them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf
over the desert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day
that succeeded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found they trace of his course, in lake or
forest or river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, after many days, had they found him; but
vague and uncertain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumors alone were their guides through a wild
and desolate country;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of
Adayes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from
the garrulous landlord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the day before, with horses and guides
and companions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel left the village, and took the road of
the prairies.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the West there lies a desert land,
where the mountains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and
luminous summits.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the
gorge, like a gateway,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the
emigrant's wagon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and
Owyhee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastward, with devious course, among the
Wind-river Mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate
leaps the Nebraska;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and
the Spanish sierras,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the
wind of the desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound,
descend to the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and
solemn vibrations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading between these streams are the
wondrous, beautiful prairies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow
and sunshine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and
purple amorphas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wander the buffalo herds, and the elk
and the roebuck;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wander the wolves, and herds of
riderless horses;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are
weary with travel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wander the scattered tribes of
Ishmael's children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staining the desert with blood; and above their
terrible wartrails<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic,
the vulture,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the implacable soul of a chieftain
slaughtered in battle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the
heavens.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there rise smokes from the camps of
these savage marauders;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there rise groves from the margins of
swift-running rivers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk
of the desert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots
by the brookside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over all is the sky, the clear and
crystalline heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the protecting hand of God inverted above
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into this wonderful land, at the base of the
Ozark Mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and
trappers behind him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day, with their Indian guides, the
maiden and Basil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed his flying steps, and thought each day
to o'ertake him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the
smoke of his camp-fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise in the morning air from the distant plain;
but at nightfall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had reached the place, they found
only embers and ashes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though their hearts were sad at times and
their bodies were weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata
Morgana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated
and vanished before them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, as they sat by their evening fire,
there silently entered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose
features<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as
great as her sorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her
people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the far-off hunting grounds of the cruel
Comanches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where her Canadian husband, a coureur-des-bois,
had been murdered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched were their hearts at her story, and
warmest and friendliest welcome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and
feasted among them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on
the embers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when their meal was done, and Basil and all
his companions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn with the long day's march and the chase of
the deer and the bison,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept
where the quivering fire-light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their
forms wrapped up in their blankets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat
and repeated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of
her Indian accent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tale of her love, with its pleasures,
and pains, and reverses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know
that another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hapless heart like her own had loved and had
been disappointed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and
woman's compassion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had
suffered was near her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She in turn related her love and all its
disasters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she
had ended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still was mute; but at length, as if a
mysterious horror<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed through her brain, she spake, and
repeated the tale of the Mowis;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and
wedded a maiden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when the morning came, arose and passed
from the wigwam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fading and melting away and dissolving into the
sunshine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she beheld him no more, though she
followed far into the forest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed
like a weird incantation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was
wooed by a phantom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, through the pines o'er her father's
lodge, in the hush of the twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered
love to the maiden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she followed his green and waving plume
through the forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by
her people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent with wonder and strange surprise,
Evangeline listened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the soft flow of her magical words, till the
region around her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy
guest the enchantress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the
moon rose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious
splendor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and
filling the woodland.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and
the branches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible
whispers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with the thoughts of love was
Evangeline's heart, but a secret,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite
terror,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the
nest of the swallow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no earthly fear. A breath from the
region, of spirits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to float in the air of night; and she
felt for a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was
pursuing a phantom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with this thought she slept, and the fear
and the phantom had vanished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early upon the morrow the march was resumed,
and the Shawnee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, as they journeyed along,--"On the western
slope of these mountains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells in his little village the Black Robe
chief of the Mission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much he teaches the people, and tells them of
Mary and Jesus;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with
pain, as they hear him."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a sudden and secret emotion,
Evangeline answered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us go to the Mission, for there good
tidings await us!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a
spur of the mountains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur
of voices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of
a river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of
the Jesuit Mission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst
of the village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A
crucifix fastened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed
by grapevines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with its agonized face on the multitude
kneeling beneath it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the
intricate arches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their
vespers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and
sighs of the branches.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, with heads uncovered, the travelers,
nearer approaching,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the
evening devotions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the service was done, and the
benediction had fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed
from the hands of the sower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the reverend man advanced to the
strangers, and bade them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with
benignant expression,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the homelike sounds of his
mother-tongue in the forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with words of kindness, conducted them
into his wigwam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on
cakes of the maize-ear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the
water-gourd of the teacher.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was their story told; and the priest with
solemnity answered:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel,
seated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this mat by my side, where now the maiden
reposes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told me this same sad tale; then arose and
continued his journey!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake
with an accent of kindness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in
winter the snowflakes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall into some lone nest from which the birds
have departed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far to the north he has gone," continued the
priest; "but in autumn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chase is done, will return again to
the Mission."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek
and submissive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad
and afflicted."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So seemed it wise and well unto all; and
betimes on the morrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian
guides and companions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed
at the Mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded
each other,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days and weeks and months; and the fields of
maize that were springing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green from the ground when a stranger she came,
now waving about her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves
interlacing, and forming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries
pillaged by squirrels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the golden weather the maize was
husked, and the maidens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that
betokened a lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the crooked laughed, and called it a
thief in the cornfield.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought
not her lover.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patience!" the priest would say; "have faith,
and thy prayer will be answered!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this delicate plant that lifts its head
from the meadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how its leaves all point to the north, as
true as the magnet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the compass-flower, that the finger of
God has suspended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on its fragile stalk to direct the
traveler's journey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of
the desert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such in the soul of man is faith. The blossoms
of passion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and
fuller of fragrance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and
their odor is deadly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this humble plant can guide us here, and
hereafter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet
with the dews of nepenthe."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So came the autumn, and passed, and the
winter--yet Gabriel came not;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of
the robin and bluebird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet
Gabriel came not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor
was wafted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of
blossom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far to the north and east, it said, in the
Michigan forests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the
Saginaw River.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with returning guides, that sought the
lakes of St. Lawrence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the
Mission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When over weary ways, by long and perilous
marches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had attained at length the depths of the
Michigan forests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and
fallen to ruin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in
seasons and places<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divers and distant far was seen the wandering
maiden;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian
Missions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of
the army,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous
cities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a phantom she came, and passed away
unremembered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she and young, when in hope began the
long journey;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded was she and old, when in disappointment
it ended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each succeeding year stole something away from
her beauty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the
gloom and the shadow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of
gray o'er her forehead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her
earthly horizon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks
of the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In that delightful land which is washed by the
Delaware's waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the
apostle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the
city he founded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There all the air is balm, and the peach is the
emblem of beauty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the streets still re-echo the names of the
trees of the forest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose
haunts they molested.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There from the troubled sea had Evangeline
landed, an exile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding among the children of Penn a home and a
country.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There old Ren&eacute; Leblanc had died; and
when he departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw at his side only one of all his hundred
descendants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something at least there was in the friendly
streets of the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that spake to her heart, and made her
no longer a stranger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou
of the Quakers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it recalled the past, the old Acadian
country,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all men were equal, and all were brothers
and sisters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed
endeavor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended, to recommence no more upon earth,
uncomplaining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned
her thoughts and her footsteps.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a mountain's top the rainy mists of the
morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape
below us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities
and hamlets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw
the world far below her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark no longer, but all illumined with love;
and the pathway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and
fair in the distance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was
his image,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as
last she beheld him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only more beautiful made by his deathlike
silence and absence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for
it was not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over him years had no power; he was not
changed, but transfigured;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had become to her heart as one who is dead,
and not absent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion
to others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow
had taught her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was her love diffused, but, like to some
odorous spices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the
air with aroma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but
to follow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly with reverent steps, the sacred feet of
her Saviour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy;
frequenting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes
of the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where distress and want concealed themselves
from the sunlight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished
neglected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night when the world was asleep, as
the watchman repeated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was
well in the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High at some lonely window he saw the light of
her taper.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow
through the suburbs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and
fruits for the market,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met he that meek, pale face, returning home
from its watchings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell
on the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by
flocks of wild pigeons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught
in their craws but an acorn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month
of September,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to
a lake in the meadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its
natural margin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of
existence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to
charm, the oppressor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all perished alike beneath the scourge of
his anger;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends
nor attendants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the
homeless.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of
meadows and woodlands;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its
gateway and wicket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble
walls seem to echo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the words of the Lord:--"The poor ye
always have with you."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister
of Mercy. The dying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed,
to behold there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead
with splendor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of
saints and apostles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a
distance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city
celestial,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits
would enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the
streets, deserted and silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of
the almshouse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers
in the garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she paused on her way to gather the fairest
among them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the dying once more might rejoice in their
fragrance and beauty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as she mounted the stairs to the
corridors, cooled by the east-wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes
from the belfry of Christ Church,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, intermingled with these, across the
meadows were wafted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes
in their church at Wicaco.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the
hour on her spirit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something within her said, "At length thy
trials are ended;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with light in her looks, she entered the
chambers of sickness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful
attendants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching
brow, and in silence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and
concealing their faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of
snow by the roadside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline
entered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she
passed, for her presence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on
the walls of a prison.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she looked around, she saw how Death,
the consoler,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed
it forever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many familiar forms had disappeared in the
night time;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant their places were, or filled already by
strangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a
feeling of wonder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart,
while a shudder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the
flowerets dropped from her fingers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her eyes and cheeks the light and
bloom of the morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such
terrible anguish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the dying heard it, and started up from
their pillows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pallet before her was stretched the form
of an old man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that
shaded his temples;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as he lay in the morning light, his face
for a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to assume once more the forms of its
earlier manhood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So are wont to be changed the faces of those
who are dying.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush
of the fever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had
besprinkled its portals,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and
pass over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his
spirit exhausted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to be sinking down through infinite
depths in the darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking
and sinking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through those realms of shade, in
multiplied reverberations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush
that succeeded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and
saintlike,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel! O my beloved!" and died away into
silence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home
of his childhood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among
them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and,
walking under their shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in
his vision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he
lifted his eyelids,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt
by his bedside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the
accents unuttered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died on his lips, and their motion revealed
what his tongue would have spoken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline,
kneeling beside him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her
bosom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it
suddenly sank into darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind
at a casement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was ended now, the hope, and the fear,
and the sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the aching of heart, the restless,
unsatisfied longing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish
of patience!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head
to her bosom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured,
"Father, I thank thee!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still stands the forest primeval; but far
away from its shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side, in their nameless graves, the
lovers are sleeping.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the humble walls of the little Catholic
churchyard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and
unnoticed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing
beside them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are
at rest and forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no
longer are busy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have
ceased from their labors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have
completed their journey!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still stands the forest primeval; but under
the shade of its branches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells another race, with other customs and
language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only along the shore of the mournful and misty
Atlantic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers
from exile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered back to their native land to die in
its bosom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom
are still busy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their
kirtles of homespun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's
story,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced,
neighboring ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the
wail of the forest.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">HELPS TO STUDY.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> The early history
of Nova Scotia records the conflict for supremacy between the French and
the English. By the French the country was called Acadie, The Acadians
were essentially French in blood and in their sympathies, though the
English were from time to time in authority over the country. At one
time the English demanded an oath of allegiance from the Acadians. This
they refused unless it should be so modified as to exempt them from
bearing arms against France. It was finally decided to remove the
Acadians from the country, scattering them throughout the colonies in
such a way as to prevent their concerted action in attempting to return
to their homes. Accordingly they were driven on board the English
transports and three thousand of them sent out of the country. In the
confusion incident to their removal, families and friends were
separated, in many cases never to meet again. The story of Evangeline is
a recital of such separation.</p>

<p><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build me
straight, O worthy Master!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staunch and strong, a
goodly vessel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall laugh at all disaster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and
whirlwind wrestle!"</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant's
word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighted the Master heard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his heart was in his work, and the heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giveth grace unto every Art.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet smile played round his lips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the eddies and dimples of the tide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play round the bows of ships,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That steadily at anchor ride.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a voice that was full of glee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "Ere long we will launch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vessel as goodly, and strong, and staunch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever weathered a wintry sea!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first with nicest skill and art,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect and finished in every part,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little model the Master wrought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be to the larger plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the child is to the man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its counterpart in miniature;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with a hand more swift and sure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater labor might be brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer to his inward thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he labored his mind ran o'er<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various ships that were built of yore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above them all, and strangest of all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose picture was hanging on the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bows and stern raised high in air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And balconies hanging here and there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signal lanterns and flags afloat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eight round towers, like those that frown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From some old castle, looking down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the drawbridge and the moat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, with a smile, "Our ship, I wis,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be of another form than this!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was of another
form, indeed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built for freight, and yet for speed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful and gallant craft;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing down upon sail and mast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the beam, but sloping aft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With graceful curve and slow degrees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she might be docile to the helm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the currents of parted seas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing behind, with mighty force,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might aid and not impede her course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ship-yard
stood the Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the model of the
vessel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should laugh at all disaster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and
whirlwind wrestle!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering many a
rood of ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the timber piled around;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered here and there, with these,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knarred and crooked cedar knees;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought from regions far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Pascagoula's sunny bay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what a wondrous thing it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To note how many wheels of toil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought, one word, can set in motion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's not a ship that sails the ocean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every climate, every soil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must bring its tribute, great or small,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help to build
the wooden wall!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was rising o'er the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long the level shadows lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they, too, the beams would be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some great, airy argosy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Framed and launched in a single day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silent architect, the sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had hewn and laid them every one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the work of man was yet begun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Master, when he spoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth, against an anchor leaning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened, to catch his slightest meaning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the long waves, as they broke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ripples on the pebbly beach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupted the old man's speech.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful they
were, in sooth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man and the fiery youth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man, in whose busy brain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a ship that sailed the main<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was modelled o'er and o'er again;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery youth, who was to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heir of his dexterity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had built and launched from land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the elder head had planned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus," said he,
"will we build this ship!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay square the blocks upon the slip,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow well this plan of mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the timbers with greatest care;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that is unsound beware;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For only what is sound and strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this vessel shall belong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here together shall combine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the UNION be her name!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the day that gives her to the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall give my daughter unto thee!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enraptured the young man heard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he turned his face aside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of joy and a thrill of pride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father's door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the form of his promised bride.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shone on her golden hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a beauteous barge was she,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still at rest on the sandy beach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beyond the billow's reach;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, how skilful grows the hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That obeyeth Love's command!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the heart, and not the brain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the highest doth attain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who followeth Love's behest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far exceedeth all the rest!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with the
rising of the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the noble task begun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were heard the intermingled sounds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of axes and of mallets, plied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vigorous arms on every side;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plied so deftly and so well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, ere the shadows of evening fell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keel of oak for a noble ship,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lying ready, and stretched along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blocks, well placed upon the slip.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy, thrice happy, every one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sees his labor well begun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not perplexed and multiplied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By idly waiting for time and tide!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the hot, long day was o'er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man at the Master's door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with the maiden calm and still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And within the porch, a little more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed beyond the evening chill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father sat, and told them tales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wrecks in the great September gales,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pirates upon the Spanish Main,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ships that never came back again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance and change of a sailor's life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want and plenty, rest and strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roving fancy, like the wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic charm of foreign lands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shadows of palms, and shining sands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the tumbling surf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trembling maiden held her breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its terror and mystery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim dark sea, so like unto Death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That divides and yet unites mankind!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever the old man paused, a gleam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent group in the twilight gloom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment one might mark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had been hidden by the dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the head of the maiden lay at rest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly, on the young man's breast!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day the
vessel grew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With timbers fashioned strong and true,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sternson and keelson and sternson-knee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, framed with perfect symmetry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skeleton ship rose up to view!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around the bows and along the side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy hammers and mallets plied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after many a week, at length,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful for form and strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime in its enormous bulk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cauldron, that glowed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overflowed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amid the clamors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clattering hammers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who listened heard now and then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the Master and his men:--</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build me
straight, O worthy Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staunch and strong, a
goodly vessel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall laugh at all disaster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and
whirlwind wrestle!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With oaken brace
and copper band,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the rudder on the sand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like a thought, should have control<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the movement of the whole;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And near it the anchor, whose giant hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would reach down and grapple with the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And immovable and fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bows an image stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a cunning artist carved in wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With robes of white, that far behind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not shaped in a classic mould,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Naiad rising from the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But modeled from the Master's daughter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a dreary and misty night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding along through the rain and the dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot of some phantom hark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guiding the vessel, in its flight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a path none other knows aright!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, at last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tall and tapering mast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is swung into its place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrouds and stays<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding it firm and fast!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upon mountain and plain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell,--those lordly pines!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those grand, majestic pines!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid shouts and cheers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaded steers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting beneath the goad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged down the weary, winding road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those captive kings so straight and tall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be shorn of their streaming hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, naked and bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel the stress and the strain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wind and the reeling main,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose roar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would remind them for evermore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their native forests they should not see
again.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender, graceful spars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poise aloft in the air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the mast-head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, blue, and red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flag unrolls the Stripes and Stars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In foreign harbors shall behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flag unrolled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will be as a friendly hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched out from his native land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling his heart with memories sweet and
endless!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is finished!
and at length<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has come the bridal day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beauty and of strength.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day the vessel shall be launched!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the bay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, in all his splendors dight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sun rises to behold the sight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centuries old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paces restless to and fro,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down the sands of gold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beating heart is not at rest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far and wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ceaseless flow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard of snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaves with the heaving of his breast.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waits
impatient for his bride.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she stands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her foot upon the sands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decked with flags and streamers gay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In honor of her marriage day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound her like a veil descending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride of the gray old sea.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck
another bride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is standing by her lover's side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows from the flags and shrouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the shadows cast by clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken by many a sunny fleck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall around them on the deck.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer is
said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service read,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyous bridegroom bows his head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in tears the good old Master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes the brown hand of his son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, for he cannot speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever faster<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down his own the tears begin to run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worthy pastor--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd of that wandering flock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has the ocean for its wold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has the vessel for its fold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaping ever from rock to rock--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake, with accents mild and clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words of warning, words of cheer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the chart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sailor's heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its pleasures and its griefs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its shallows and rocky reefs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those secret currents, that flow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such resistless undertow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lift and drift, with terrible force,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will from its moorings and its course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he
spake, and thus said he:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like unto ships far off at sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outward or homeward bound, are we,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, behind, and all around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats and swings the horizon's bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems at its distant rim to rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climb the crystal wall of the skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again to turn and sink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if we could slide from its outer brink.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! it is not the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rock and rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With endless and uneasy motion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now touching the very skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sinking into the depths of ocean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! if our souls but poise and swing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the compass in its brazen ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever level and ever true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the toil and the task we have to do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall sail securely, and safely reach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be those of joy and not of fear!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gesture of command,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved his hand;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud and sudden there was heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around them and below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of hammers, blow on blow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking away the shores and spurs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see! she stirs!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She starts,--she moves,--she seems to feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrill of life along her keel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, spurning with her foot the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one exulting, joyous bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaps into the ocean's arms!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! from the
assembled crowd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the ocean seemed to say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take her, Oh bridegroom, old and gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take her to thy protecting arms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her youth and all her charms!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful she
is! How fair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lies within those arms, that press<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her form with many a soft caress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tenderness and watchful care!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail forth into the sea, O ship!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through wind and wave, right onward steer!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moistened eye, the trembling lip,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not the signs of doubt or fear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail forth into
the sea of life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O gentle, loving, trusting wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And safe from all adversity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bosom of that sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy comings and thy goings be!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gentleness and love and trust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wreck of noble lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something immortal still survives!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, too, sail
on, O Ship of State!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity with all its fears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the hopes of future years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hanging breathless on thy fate!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what Master laid thy keel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anvils rang, what hammers beat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what a forge and what a heat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not each sudden sound and shock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is of the wave and not the rock;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is but the flapping of the sail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a rent made by the gale!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of rock and tempest's roar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of false lights on the shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="JOHN_GREENLEAF_WHITTIER"></a>JOHN
GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>
<p>The year 1807 was the birth year of both Whittier and
Longfellow--two poets in whom the love of human nature is a marked
trait. Little of the scholar, however, is to be found in the New England
Quaker whose lot it was to pass from plow to politics, and from politics
to literature. John Greenleaf Whittier was born in East Haverhill, a
rugged, hilly section of Essex County, Massachusetts. In the southern
part of this same county lies Salem, where three years earlier Hawthorne
was born.</p>
<p>The home of Whittier was in a country district, and to this day no
roof is in sight from the old homestead. The house, considerably more
than a hundred years old at the time of the poet's birth, was built by
his great-great-grandfather. The Whittiers were mostly stalwart men, six
feet in height, who lived out their three-score years and ten; but the
poet, though his years were more than any of his immediate ancestors,
fell a little short of the family stature, and was of slender frame.
"Snow-bound" gives us a faithful picture of the Whittier homestead and
household, as they were eighty years ago.</p>
<p>The life they lived there was one utterly without luxury, and with
few means of culture. There were perhaps thirty hooks in the house,
largely Quaker tracts and journals. Of course there was the Bible, and
through all his poetry Whittier reverts to the Bible for phrases and
images as naturally as Longfellow turns to mediaeval legend. Memorable
were the evenings when the school teacher came and read to the family
from books he brought with him,--one most memorable, when the book was a
copy of Burns. On Whittier's first visit to Boston, an occasion honored
by his wearing "boughten buttons" on his homespun coat, and a broad-brim
hat made by his aunt out of pasteboard covered with drab velvet, he
purchased a copy of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>He attended the district school a few weeks each winter, and when he
was nineteen he completed his scanty education with a year at an academy
at Haverhill. From the time when the reading of Burns woke the poet in
him, he was constantly writing rhymes, covering his slate with them, and
sometimes copying them out painstakingly on paper.</p>
<p>Without Whittier's knowledge, his sister sent one of his poems to a
paper in a neighboring town. The Editor became interested in his
contributor and, as the story goes, drove out to the country home and
Whittier was called in from the field to meet the smart young newspaper
man. Thus began his literary career.</p>
<p>He became an Editor in Boston and later in Hartford, but the work
proving too trying for his delicate health, he returned to the farm.
Meanwhile, he was contributing verse to the newspapers.</p>
<p>During this time he was elected to the Legislature of Massachusetts
and had some prospects of being nominated for Congress.</p>
<p>Later in life he returned again and again to the purely lyrical
notes which he had taken up in his youth.</p>
<p>Two subjects always appealed strongly to Whitter's poetic
imagination. One is the slender body of legendary lore that has come
down to us from the colonial days of New England, including a few tales
of the trials and persecutions of the early Quaker. "Skipper Ireson's
Ride" belongs to this group of ballads. The other favorite field of
Whittier's poetic fancy was the humble rural life of his own
childhood--"In School-Days" and "Snow-Bound" belong to this class of New
England idyls. The latter will always be a favorite with American
readers, both for its simple rustic pictures, and for its deep religious
faith.</p>
<p>Whittier never married. The little romances of his youth slipped
quietly into memories, and imparted a finer tone to the poetry of his
maturer years. He died at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, in the
eighty-fifth year of his age. Holmes was the only one of the New England
singers left to mourn his departure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Best loved and
saintliest of our singing train,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's noblest
tributes to thy name belong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lifelong record
closed without a stain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blameless memory
shrined in deathless song."</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, darkly circled, gave at noon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sadder light than
waning moon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow tracing down the
thickening sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mute and ominous prophecy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portent seeming less than threat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sank from sight before it set.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill no coat, however stout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of homespun stuff could quite shut out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hard, dull bitterness of cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That checked, mid-vein, the circling race<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life-blood in the sharpened face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming of the snow-storm told.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew east; we heard the roar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ocean on his wintry shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the strong pulse throbbing there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat with low rhythm our inland air.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile we did
our nightly chores,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought in the wood from out of doors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Littered the stalls, and from the mows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raked down the herd's-grass for the cows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, sharply clashing horn on horn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient down the stanchion rows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cattle shake their walnut bows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, peering from his early perch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the scaffold's pole of birch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock his crested helmet bent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down his querulous challenge sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwarmed by any sunset light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray day darkened into night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night made hoary with the swarm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As zigzag wavering to and fro<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed and recrossed the winged snow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere the early bedtime came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white drift piled the window-frame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the glass the clothes-line posts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all night long the storm roared on:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning broke without a sun;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tiny spherule traced with lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nature's geometric signs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In starry flake and pellicle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day the hoary meteor fell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when the second morning shone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked upon a world unknown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nothing we could call our own.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the glistening wonder bent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue walls of the firmament,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cloud above, no earth below,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A universe of sky and snow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old familiar sights of ours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took marvelous shapes; strange domes and towers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or garden-wall or belt of wood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fenceless drift what once was road;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridle-post an old man sat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-curb had a Chinese roof;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the long sweep, high aloof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its slant splendor, seemed to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pisa's leaning miracle.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prompt,
decisive man, no breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our father wasted: "Boys, a path!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count such a summons less than joy?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our buskins on our feet we drew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mittened hands,
and caps drawn low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guard our necks and
ears from snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cut the solid whiteness through;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, where the drift was deepest, made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tunnel walled and overlaid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dazzling crystal: we had read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rare Aladdin's wondrous cave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to our own his name we gave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a wish the luck were ours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test his lamp's supernal powers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached the barn with merry din,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roused the prisoned brutes within.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old horse thrust his long head out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grave with wonder gazed about;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock his lusty greeting said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forth his speckled harem led;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mild reproach of hunger looked;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn&egrave;d patriarch of the sheep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Egypt's Amun roused from sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook his sage head with gesture mute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And emphasized with stamp of foot.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day the gusty
north-wind bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loosened drift its breath before;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low circling round its southern zone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No church-bell lent its Christian tone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the savage air, no social smoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curled over woods of snow-hung oak.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solitude made more intense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By dreary-voic&egrave;d elements,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrieking of the mindless wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the glass the unmeaning beat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the circle of our hearth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No welcome sound of toil or mirth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbound the spell, and testified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human life and thought outside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We minded that the sharpest ear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buried brooklet could not hear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of whose liquid lip<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been to us companionship,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in our lonely life, had grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have an almost human tone.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As night drew on,
and, from the crest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wooded knolls that ridged the west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun, a snow-blown traveler, sank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sight beneath the smothering bank,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We piled with care our nightly stack<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wood against the chimney-back,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on its top the stout back-stick;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knotty forestick laid apart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled between with curious art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ragged brush; then, hovering near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We watched the first red blaze appear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the old, rude-furnished room<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While radiant with a mimic flame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the sparkling drift became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the bare-boughed lilac-tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crane and pendent trammels showed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Turk's heads on the andirons glowed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While childish fancy, prompt to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the miracle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered the old rhyme: <i>"Under the tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fire outdoors burns merrily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the witches are making tea."</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon above
the eastern wood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone at its full; the hill-range stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfigured in the silver flood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its blown snows flashing cold and keen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead white, save where some sharp ravine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took shadow, or the sombre green<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the whiteness of their back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a world and such a night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most fitting that unwarming light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which only seemed where'er it fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the coldness visible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut in from all
the world without,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat the clean-winged hearth about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content to let the north-wind roar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In baffled rage at pane and door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the red logs before us beat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost-line back with tropic heat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever, when a louder blast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook beam and rafter as it passed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merrier up its roaring draught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great throat of the chimney laughed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house-dog on his paws outspread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid to the fire his drowsy head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's dark silhouette on the wall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couchant tiger's seemed to fall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for the winter fireside meet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the andirons' straddling feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mug of cider simmered slow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apples sputtered in a row,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, close at hand, the basket stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nuts from brown October's wood.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter how
the night behaved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter how the north-wind raved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow high, blow low, not all its snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Time and Change!--with hair as gray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was my sire's that winter day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange it seems, with so much gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life and love, to still live on!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, brother! only I and thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are left of all that circle now,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dear home faces whereupon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fitful firelight paled and shone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforward, listen as we will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of that hearth are still;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look where we may, the wide earth o'er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lighted faces smile no more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tread the paths their feet have worn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit beneath their
orchard trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear, like them, the
hum of bees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rustle of the bladed corn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn the pages that they read,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their written words we
linger o'er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the sun they cast no shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No voice is heard, no sign is made,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No step is on the
conscious floor!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Love will dream and Faith will trust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since He who knows our need is just)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That somehow, somewhere, meet we must.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas for him who never sees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars shine through his cypress-trees!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor looks to see the breaking day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mournful marbles play!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath not learned, in hours of faith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth to flesh and
sense unknown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Life is ever lord of Death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love can never lose
its own!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sped the time
with stories old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought puzzles out, and riddles told,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stammered from our school-book lore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief of Gambia's golden shore."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our father rode again his ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Memphremagog's wooded side;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat down again to moose and samp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trapper's hut and Indian camp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived o'er the old idyllic ease<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath St. Fran&ccedil;ois' hemlock trees;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again for him the moonlight shone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Norman cap and bodiced zone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again he heard the violin play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which led the village dance away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled in its merry whirl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandam and the laughing girl.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, nearer home, our steps he led<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Salisbury's level marshes spread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mile-wide as flies the
laden bee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where merry mowers, hale and strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low green prairies
of the sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shared the fishing off Boar's Head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round the rocky
Isles of Shoals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hake-broil on the
driftwood coals;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chowder on the sand-beach made,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipped by the hungry, steaming hot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spoons of clam-shell from the pot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the tales of witchcraft old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream and sign and marvel told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleepy listeners as they lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched idly on the salted hay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrift along the winding shores,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When favoring breezes
deigned to blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square sail of the
gundalow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And idle lay the useless oars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mother, while she turned her wheel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or run the new-knit stocking-heel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told how the Indian hordes came down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight on Cochecho town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how her own great-uncle bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cruel scalp-mark to fourscore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling, in her fitting phrase,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rich and picturesque
and free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The common unrhymed poetry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of simple life and country ways),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of her early days,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made us welcome to her home;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old hearths grew wide to give us room;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stole with her a frightened look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gray wizard's conjuring-book,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fame whereof went far and wide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the simple country-side;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the hawks at twilight play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat-horn on Piscataqua,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loon's weird laughter far away;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fished her
little trout-brook, knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What flowers in wood and meadow grew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sunny hillsides autumn-brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw where in sheltered cove and bay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ducks' black squadron anchored lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the wild geese calling loud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the gray November cloud.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, haply, with a look more grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soberer tone, some tale she gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From painful Sewel's ancient tome,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved in every Quaker home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of faith fire-winged by martyrdom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Chalkley's Journal, old and quaint,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint!--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, when the dreary calms prevailed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And water-butt and bread-cask failed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cruel, hungry eyes pursued<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His portly presence, mad for food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark hints muttered under breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of casting lots for life or death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offered, if Heaven withheld supplies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be himself the sacrifice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, suddenly, as if to save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good man from his living grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ripple on the water grew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school of porpoise flashed in view.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take, eat," he said, "and be content;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fishes in my stead are sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Him who gave the tangled ram<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spare the child of Abraham."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our uncle,
innocent of books,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was rich in lore of fields and brooks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient teachers never dumb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nature's unhoused lyceum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moons and tides and weather wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read the clouds as prophecies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And foul or fair could well divine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many an occult hint and sign,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the cunning-warded keys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the woodcraft mysteries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself to Nature's heart so near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all her voices in his ear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beast or bird had meanings clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Apollonius of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew the tales the sparrows told,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Hermes, who interpreted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the sage cranes of Nilus said;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple, guileless, childlike man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content to live where life began;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong only on his native grounds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little world of sights and sounds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose girdle was the parish bounds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof his fondly partial pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common features magnified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Surrey hills to mountains grew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In White of Selborne's loving view,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told how teal and loon he shot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the eagle's eggs he got,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feats on pond and river done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prodigies of rod and gun;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, warming with the tales he told,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgotten was the outside cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitter wind unheeded blew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From ripening corn the pigeons flew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partridge drummed i' the wood, the mink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went fishing down the river-brink.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fields with bean or clover gay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodchuck, like a hermit gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peered from the doorway
of his cell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muskrat plied the mason's trade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tier by tier his mud-walls laid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the shagbark overhead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grizzled squirrel
dropped his shell.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the dear
aunt, whose smile of cheer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voice in dreams I see and hear,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest woman ever Fate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perverse denied a household mate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, lonely, homeless, not the less<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found peace in love's unselfishness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And welcome whereso'er she went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A calm and gracious element,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose presence seemed the sweet income<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And womanly atmosphere of home,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called up her girlhood memories,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huskings and the apple-bees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleigh-rides and the summer sails,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving through all the poor details<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And homespun warp of circumstance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden woof-thread of romance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For well she kept her genial mood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And simple faith of maidenhood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her still a cloud-land lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirage loomed across her way;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning dew, that dried so soon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With others, glistened at her noon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through years of toil and soil and care,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From glossy tress to thin gray hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unprofaned she held apart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virgin fancies of the heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be shame to him of woman born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had for such but thought of scorn.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, too, our
elder sister plied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her evening task the stand beside;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full, rich nature, free to trust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truthful and almost sternly just,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impulsive, earnest, prompt to act,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make her generous thought a fact,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping with many a light disguise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of self-sacrifice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O heart sore-tried! thou hast the best<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Heaven itself could give thee,--rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest from all bitter thoughts and things!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many a poor one's
blessing went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thee beneath the
low green tent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose curtain never outward swings!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who held
herself a part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all she saw, and let her heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the household
bosom lean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the motley-braided mat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our youngest and our dearest sat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now bathed within the fadeless green<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holy peace of Paradise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, looking from some heavenly hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or from the shade of
saintly palms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or silver reach of
river calms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do those large eyes behold me still?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With me one little year ago:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill weight of the winter snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months upon her
grave has lain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, when summer south-winds blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brier and harebell
bloom again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tread the pleasant paths we trod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the violet-sprinkled sod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon she leaned, too frail and weak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hillside flowers she loved to seek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet following me where'er I went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark eyes full of love's content.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are glad; the brier-rose fills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air with sweetness; all the hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch green to June's unclouded sky;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still I wait with ear and eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For something gone which should be nigh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loss in all familiar things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flower that blooms, and bird that sings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, dear heart! remembering thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I not richer than of
old?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe in thy immortality,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What change can reach
the wealth I hold?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What chance can mar the
pearl and gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy love hath left in trust with me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while in life's late afternoon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where cool and long the
shadows grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walk to meet the night that soon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall shape and shadow
overflow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot feel that thou art far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since near at need the angels are;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the sunset gates unbar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I not see thee
waiting stand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, white against the evening star,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome of thy beckoning hand?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brisk wielder of
the birch and rule,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master of the district school<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held at the fire his favored place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its warm glow lit a laughing face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertain prophecy of beard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He teased the mitten-blinded cat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played cross-pins on my uncle's hat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang songs, and told us what befalls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In classic Dartmouth's college halls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born the wild Northern hills among,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whence his yeoman father wrung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By patient toil subsistence scant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not competence and yet not want,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He early gained the power to pay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheerful, self-reliant way;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could doff at ease his scholar's gown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To peddle wares from town to town;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or through the long vacation's reach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lonely lowland districts teach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all the droll experience found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At stranger hearths in boarding round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlit skater's keen delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleigh-drive through the frosty night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rustic party, with its rough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accompaniment of blind-man's-buff,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirling plate, and forfeits paid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His winter task a pastime made.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy the snow-locked homes wherein<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tuned his merry violin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or played the athlete in the barn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or held the good dame's winding yarn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mirth-provoking versions told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of classic legends rare and old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had all the commonplace of home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little seemed at best the odds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt Yankee peddlers and old gods;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Pindus-born Arachthus took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guise of any grist-mill brook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dread Olympus at his will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became a huckleberry hill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A careless boy that night he seemed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at his desk he had
the look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And air of one who wisely schemed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hostage from the
future took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In train&egrave;d
thought and lore of book.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another guest that winter night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmarked by time, and yet not young,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honeyed music of her tongue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And words of meekness scarcely told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nature passionate and bold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong, self-concentred, spurning guide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its milder features dwarfed beside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her unbent will's majestic pride.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat among us, at the best,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A not unfeared, half-welcome guest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuking with her cultured phrase<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our homeliness of words and ways.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain pard-like, treacherous grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed the lithe limbs
and dropped the lash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lent the white teeth
their dazzling flash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under low brows,
black with night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rayed out at times a
dangerous light;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp heat-lightnings of her face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presaging ill to him whom Fate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemned to share her love or hate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman tropical, intense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thought and act, in soul and sense,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blended in a like degree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vixen and the devotee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revealing with each freak or feint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper of Petruchio's Kate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raptures of Siena's saint.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tapering hand and rounded wrist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had facile power to form a fist;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm, dark languish of her eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never safe from wrath's surprise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brows saintly calm and lips devout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew every change of scowl and pout;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sweet voice had notes more high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shrill for social battle-cry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then what old cathedral town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What convent-gate has held its lock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the challenge of her knock!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Smyrna's plague-hushed thoroughfares,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up sea-set Malta's rocky stairs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray olive slopes of hills that hem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or startling on her desert throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crazy Queen of Lebanon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With claims fantastic as her own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tireless feet have held their way;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, unrestful, bowed and gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watches under Eastern skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hope each day
renewed and fresh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's quick coming in the flesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof she dreams and prophesies!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where'er her troubled path may be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's sweet pity
with her go!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outward wayward life we see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden springs we
may not know.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is it given us to discern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threads the fatal
sisters spun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through what ancestral
years has run<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrow with the woman born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What forged her cruel chain of moods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What set her feet in solitudes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held the love
within her mute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mingled madness in the blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lifelong discord and
annoy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water of tears with oil
of joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hid within the folded bud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perversities of flower
and fruit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not ours to separate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tangled skein of will and fate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show what metes and bounds should stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the soul's debatable land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And between choice and Providence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divide the circle of events;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But He who knows our
frame is just,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merciful and compassionate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of sweet assurances<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hope for all the language is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That He remembereth we
are dust!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last the great
logs, crumbling low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent out a dull and duller glow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bull's-eye watch, that hung in view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticking its weary circuit through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed with mutely-warning sign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its black hand to the hour of nine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sign the pleasant circle broke:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid it tenderly away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then roused himself to safely cover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull red brand with ashes over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while, with care, our mother laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work aside, her steps she stayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment, seeking to express<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her grateful sense of happiness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For food and shelter, warmth and health,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love's contentment more than wealth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With simple wishes (not the weak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such as warm the generous heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er-prompt to do with Heaven its part)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That none might lack, that bitter night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bread and clothing, warmth and light.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our beds
awhile we heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that round the gables roared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With now and then a ruder shock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made our very bedsteads rock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the loosened clapboards tost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board-nails snapping in the frost;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on us, through the unplastered wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the lightsifted snow-flakes fall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleep stole on, as sleep will do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hearts are light and life is new;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint and more faint the murmurs grew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in the summer-land of dreams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They softened to the sound of streams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lapsing waves on quiet shores.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morn we
wakened with the shout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of merry voices high and clear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the teamsters drawing near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break the drifted highways out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long hillside treading slow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the half-buried oxen go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking the snow from heads uptost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their straining nostrils white with frost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our door the straggling train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew up, an added team to gain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders threshed their hands a-cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed, with the
cider-mug, their jokes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From lip to lip; the
younger folks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toiled again the cavalcade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er windy hill,
through clogged ravine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woodland paths that
wound between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low drooping-pine-boughs winter-weighed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From every barn a team afoot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every house a new recruit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, drawn by Nature's subtlest law,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply the watchful young men saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet doorway pictures of the curls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And curious eyes of merry girls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting their hands in mock defense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the snow-balls' compliments,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reading in each missive tost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charm which Eden never lost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard once more the sleigh-bells' sound;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, following where the teamsters led,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise old Doctor went his round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just pausing at our door to say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brief autocratic way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one who, prompt at Duty's call,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was free to urge her claim on all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That some poor neighbor
sick abed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night our mother's aid would need.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, one in generous thought and deed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mattered in the
sufferer's sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quaker matron's
inward light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doctor's mail of Calvin's creed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hearts confess the saints elect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, twain, in faith,
in love agree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And melt not in an acid sect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian pearl of
charity!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So days went on: a week
had passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the great world was heard from last.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Almanac we studied o'er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read and reread our little store<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of books and pamphlets, scarce a score;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One harmless novel, mostly hid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From younger eyes, a book forbid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poetry, (or good or bad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single book was all we had,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Ellwood's meek, drab-skirted Muse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger to the
heathen Nine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang, with a somewhat
nasal whine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wars of David and the Jews.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last the floundering carrier bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village paper to our door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! broadening outward as we read,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To warmer zones the horizon spread;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In panoramic length unrolled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the marvel that it told.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before us passed the painted Creeks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daft McGregor on
his raids<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Costa Rica's
everglades.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up Taygetus winding slow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode Ypsilanti's Mainote Greeks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Turk's head at each saddle bow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to us its week-old news,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its corner for the rustic Muse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its monthly gauge of
snow and rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its record, mingling in a breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding bell and dirge of death;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest culprit sent to jail;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its hue and cry of stolen and lost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its vendue sales and goods at cost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And traffic calling
loud for gain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt the stir of hall and street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pulse of life that round us beat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill embargo of the snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was melted in the genial glow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide swung again our ice-locked door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world was ours once more!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasp, Angel of
the backward look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And folded wings of
ashen gray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voice of echoes far
away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brazen covers of thy book;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird palimpsest old and vast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein thou hid'st the spectral past;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, closely mingling, pale and glow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characters of joy and woe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monographs of outlived years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or smile-illumined or dim with tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green hills of life
that slope to death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haunts of home, whose vistaed trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shade off to mournful cypresses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the white
amaranths underneath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even while I look, I can but heed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restless sands'
incessant fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importunate hours that hours succeed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each clamorous with its own sharp need,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And duty keeping pace
with all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut down and clasp the heavy lids;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear again the voice that bids<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamer leave his dream midway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For larger hopes and graver fears:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life greatens in these later years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The century's aloe flowers today!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, haply, in
some lull of life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Truce of God which breaks its strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worldling's eyes shall gather dew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreaming in throngful
city ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of winter joys his boyhood knew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dear and early friends--the few<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who yet remain--shall pause to view<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Flemish pictures
of old days;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit with me by the homestead hearth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stretch the hands of memory forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To warm them at the
wood-fire's blaze!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thanks untraced to lips unknown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall greet me like the odors blown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From unseen meadows newly mown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lilies floating in some pond,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveler owns the grateful sense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sweetness near, he knows not whence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, pausing, takes with forehead bare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benediction of the air.<br>

WENDELL HOLMES</p>
<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes's birth year, 1809, was made memorable on both
sides of the Atlantic by the births of Lincoln, Tennyson, Poe, and
Gladstone. His father, of colonial descent, was a Congregational
minister at Cambridge. On his mother's side--the Wendells or Vondels--he
was of Dutch descent.</p>
<p>Holmes was brought up very simply in the old gambrel-roofed house,
half parsonage and half farm house. He read the "New England Primer,"
"Pilgrim's Progress" and such poems as were to be found in the early
school books. Later he was a student at Harvard, a member of the class
of 1829, which, while not to be compared for literary genius with the
Bowdoin class of 1825, was one of Harvard's most famous classes. Not
long after his graduation, the class of 1829 began to held annual
dinners and Holmes was regularly called upon to furnish an ode for the
occasion. It was on the thirtieth anniversary that he wrote and recited
"The Boys." In 1889, at the sixtieth anniversary, he wrote the last
class poem, "After the Curfew."</p>
<p>It was in the first year after his graduation that his verses went
into type and then he says he had his first attack of "lead poisoning."
After leaving Harvard he studied law for a while and then turned to
medicine and surgery, spending two years in study in Paris. It is a
singular coincidence and shows his double work in life, that in 1836
when he published his first volume of poems he also took his degree as
doctor of medicine. As a physician he was always deeply interested in
the problems of heredity and he wrote several novels in which inherited
characteristics play an important part.</p>
<p>It was in September, 1830, that Holmes chanced to read in a
newspaper of the proposal of the Navy Department to dismantle the
frigate Constitution, which had done such good service in 1812 but which
was then lying, old and unseaworthy, in the navy yard at Charleston. He
wrote at once with a lead pencil on a scrap of paper the stirring verses
"Old Ironsides" and sent them to the Boston Daily Advertiser, from which
they were copied in all the papers of the country. The frigate was
converted into a school-ship, and Oliver Wendell Holmes became known as
a poet.</p>
<p>On every public occasion which could be enlivened or dignified by a
special poem, Dr. Holmes was called upon. Such a position is a trying
one and one to which only men with a sense of humor are often called.
The doctor rarely refused to respond; so that nearly one-half of his
verse is of this occasional character. Much of his verse is in lighter
vein, but of the serious, surest in their hold upon his readers are "The
Last Leaf" and "The Chambered Nautilus." But Holmes, while he had a
genuine gift of song, was no persistent singer like Longfellow or
Whittier, and so he reached almost the age of fifty without feeling that
the reading public had any special interest in him. Then in 1857, when
the Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell took the editorship
only on condition that Holmes would be a contributor, he wrote the
"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table." In this role of talker, comfortable,
brilliant, and witty, Holmes made friends wherever the Autocrat was read.</p>
<p>Holmes's intellect remained bright and he continued an active worker
into extreme old age. In 1890 he published his last volume, "Over the
Teacups." As one by one this brilliant company of New England writers
left the world, Holmes sang to each a farewell song. When his own time
came he was really "The Last Leaf upon the Tree." The end came
peacefully as he was talking to his son, October 7, 1894.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>A LOGICAL STORY</small></p>

<p><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you heard
of the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was built in such a logical way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ran a hundred years to a day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, of a sudden, it----ah, but stay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell you what happened without delay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scaring the parson into fits,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightening people out of their wits,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever heard of that, I say?</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventeen hundred
and fifty-five.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snuffy old drone from the German hive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the year when Lisbon-town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the earth open and gulp her down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Braddock's army was done so brown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left without a scalp to its crown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was on the terrible Earthquake-day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in building
of chaises, I tell you what,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest
spot,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,--lurking, still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find it somewhere you must and will,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above or below, or within or without,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't <i>wear
out</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Deacon
swore, (as Deacons do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an "I dew vum," or an "I tell <i>yeou</i>,")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would build one shay to beat the taown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be so built that it <i>couldn</i>'
break daown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--"Fur," said the Deacon, "'t's mighty plain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thut the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'N' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain, is only
jest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Deacon
inquired of the village folk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he could find the strongest oak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was for spokes and floor and sills;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent for lancewood to make the thills;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crossbars were ash, from the straightest
trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lasts like iron for things like these;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hubs of logs from the "Settler's ellum,"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never an axe had seen their chips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wedges flew from between their lips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel of the finest, bright and blue;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoroughbrace, bison-skin, thick and wide;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found in the pit when the tanner died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the way he "put her through."--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There!" said the Deacon, "naow she'll dew."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do! I tell you, I
rather guess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a wonder, and nothing less!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deacon and deaconess dropped away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children and grandchildren--where were they?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIGHTEEN
HUNDRED;--it came and found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running as usual; much the same.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty and forty at last arrive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then came fifty, and FIFTY-FIVE.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little of all we
value here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without both feeling and looking queer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as I know, but a tree and truth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is a moral that runs at large;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take it.--You're welcome.--No extra charge.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of
November,--the Earthquake-day.--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general flavor of mild decay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing local, as one may say.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There couldn't be--for the Deacon's art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made it so like in every part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there wasn't a chance for one to start.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wheels were just as strong as the
thills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the floor was just as strong as the sills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the panels just as strong as the floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whippletree neither less nor more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spring and axle and hub <i>encore</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, <i>as a whole</i>, it is past a doubt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another hour it will be <i>worn out</i>!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of
November, fifty-five!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning the parson takes a drive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, small boys, get out of the way!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huddup!" said the parson.--Off went they.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parson was working his Sunday's text,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had got to <i>fifthly</i>, and stopped
perplexed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what the--Moses--was coming next.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once the horse stood still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a shiver,
and then a thrill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then something decidedly like a spill,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the parson was sitting upon a rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think the parson found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up and stared around?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it had been to the mill and ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it went to pieces all at once,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once, and nothing first,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as bubbles do when they burst.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of the
wonderful one-hoss shay,<br>

the name given the frigate Constitution. It was proposed by the
Secretary of the Navy to dispose of the ship as it had become unfit for
service. Popular sentiment did not approve of this. It was said a ship
which was the pride of the nation should continue to be the property of
the Navy and be rebuilt for service when needed. Holmes wrote this poem

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="JAMES_RUSSELL_LOWELL"></a>JAMES
RUSSELL LOWELL</span></p>
<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL was born at Cambridge in the beautiful house
known as Elmwood. He was more fortunate than most Americans, for in this
same house he lived and died. The dwelling at Elmwood was like Craigie
House, an historic place of Revolutionary memories. The secluded, ample
grounds made a fine rural refuge for a youth of poetic fancies. Nor was
there only wealth for the nature-lover of outdoors; there were also
treasures for the lover of books within. The Lowell library was the
accumulation of several generations of scholarly men, and Lowell from
early youth was familiar with books which Whittier even in the studious
leisure of old age never looked into.</p>
<p>Lowell was twelve years younger than Longfellow and was a sophomore
when Longfellow went to Harvard as professor of Romance languages. At
Harvard Lowell distinguished himself especially in literary matters. In
the last year of his residence he was one of the editors of the college
magazine and was also elected class poet. Although he studied law, he
was never attracted to the practice of it.</p>
<p>Lowell, like Whittier, could turn from the heat and strife of public
affairs to the solace of pure poetry. Inspired by the legend of the Holy
Grail, he wrote within forty-eight hours, so we are told, the poem of
knightly aspiration and brotherly love, "The Vision of Sir Launfal."</p>
<p>In 1856, upon Longfellow's resignation, Lowell was appointed
professor of Romance Languages at Harvard, and, like Longfellow, he
remained for twenty years. In 1857 a new magazine to which Holmes had
given the name "Atlantic Monthly" was established and Lowell was its
first editor.</p>
<p>In 1877 Lowell was appointed minister to Spain, where Irving had
been sent more than thirty years before; and in 1880 he was transferred
to the court of St. James. Here he distinguished himself by tact,
courtesy, and wisdom and won the admiration of the English people.</p>
<p>Returning to America in 1885 Lowell continued to write, and
delivered addresses when his strength would permit. He spent his time
among his books and lived peacefully at Elmwood, where he died in 1891
at the age of seventy-two.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to our age's drowsy blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still shouts the
inspiring sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth gets its price for what Earth gives us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar is taxed for
a corner to die in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest hath his fee who comes and shrives
us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bargain for the
graves we lie in;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Devil's booth are all things sold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cap and bells our
lives we pay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bubbles we buy with a whole soul's tasking:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis heaven alone that
is given away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis only God may be had for the asking;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No price is set on the lavish summer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June may be had by the poorest comer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is so
rare as a day in June?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if ever, come
perfect days;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Heaven tries earth if it be in tune,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over it softly her
warm ear lays;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we look, or whether we listen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every clod feels a stir of might,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instinct within it
that reaches and towers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, groping blindly above it for light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbs to a soul in
grass and flowers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flush of life may well be seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrilling back over
hills and valleys;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cowslip startles in meadows green,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buttercup catches
the sun in its chalice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's never a leaf or a blade too mean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be some happy
creature's palace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little bird sits at his door in the sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atilt like a blossom
among the leaves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lets his illumined being o'errun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deluge of
summer it receives;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and
sings;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sings to the wide world, and she to her
nest,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nice ear of Nature which song is the
best?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the
high-tide of the year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whatever of life
hath ebbed away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes flooding back with a ripply cheer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into every bare inlet
and creek and bay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the heart is so full that a drop overfills
it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy now because God wills it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how barren the past may have been,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis enough for us now that the leaves are
green;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit in the warm shade and feel right well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That skies are clear and grass is growing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze comes whispering in our ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dandelions are blossoming near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That maize has
sprouted, that streams are flowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river is bluer than the sky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the robin is plastering his house hard by;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the breeze kept the good news back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other couriers we should not lack;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could guess it all
by yon heifer's lowing,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hark! how clear bold chanticleer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed with the new wine of the year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells all in his lusty
crowing!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy comes, grief
goes, we know not how:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is happy now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is upward
striving;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis as easy now for the heart to be true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for grass to be green or skies to be blue,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the natural way of
living:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows whither the clouds have fled?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unscarred heaven
they leave no wake;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eyes forget the tears they have shed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart forgets its
sorrow and ache;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul partakes the season's youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sulphurous
rifts of passion and woe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie deep 'neath a silence pure and smooth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like burnt-out craters
healed with snow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wonder if Sir Launfal now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered the keeping of his vow?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">PART FIRST</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">I.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My golden spurs
now bring to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring to me my
richest mail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tomorrow I go over land and sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of the Holy
Grail;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall never a bed for me be spread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shall a pillow be under my head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I begin my vow to keep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on the rushes will I sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perchance there may come a vision true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere day create the world anew."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly Sir Launfal's
eyes grew dim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumber fell like a
cloud on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into his soul the vision flew.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">II.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows flapped
over by twos and threes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pool drowsed the cattle up to their
knees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little birds sang
as if it were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one day of summer
in all the year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle alone in the landscape lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an outpost of winter, dull and gray:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas the proudest hall in the North Countree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never its gates might opened be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save to lord or lady of high degree;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer besieged it on every side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the churlish stone her assaults defied;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not scale the chilly wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though around it for leagues her pavilions tall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched left and right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the hills and out of sight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green and broad was
every tent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of each a
murmur went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the breeze fell off at night.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">III.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawbridge
dropped with a surly clang,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the dark arch a charger sprang,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing Sir Launfal, the maiden knight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his gilded mail, that flamed so bright<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed the dark castle had gathered all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its
wall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his siege of three
hundred summers long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, binding them all in one blazing sheaf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had cast them forth:
so, young and strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightsome as a locust-leaf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launfal flashed forth in his unscarred mail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek in all climes
for the Holy Grail.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was morning on
hill and stream and tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And morning in the
young knight's heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the castle moodily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuffed the gifts of the sunshine free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gloomed by itself
apart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season brimmed all other things up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full as the rain fills the pitcher-plant's cup.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">V.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sir Launfal
made morn through the darksome gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was 'ware of a
leper, crouched by the same,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a loathing over Sir
Launfal came;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh 'neath his
armor did shrink and crawl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And midway its leap his heart stood still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a frozen waterfall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this man, so foul and bent of stature,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasped harshly against his dainty nature,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed the one blot on the summer morn,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">VI.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leper raised
not the gold from the dust:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Better to me the poor man's crust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better the blessing of the poor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I turn me empty from his door;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is no true alms which the hand can hold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives nothing but worthless gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gives from a sense
of duty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he who gives but a slender mite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gives to that which is out of sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thread of the
all-sustaining Beauty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which runs through all and doth all unite,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart outstretches its eager palms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a god goes with it and makes it store<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the soul that was starving in darkness
before."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">PRELUDE TO PART SECOND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down swept the
chill wind from the mountain peak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the snow five
thousand summers old;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On open wold and hilltop bleak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had gathered all the
cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer's
cheek;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It carried a shiver everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little brook heard it and built a roof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath which he could house him, winter-proof;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night by the white stars' frosty gleams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groined his arches and matched his beams;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slender and clear were his crystal spars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lashes of light that trim the stars;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sculptured every summer delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his halls and chambers out of sight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending to counterfeit a breeze;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But silvery mosses that downward grew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the gladness of heaven to shine through,
and here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hung them thickly with diamond-drops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crystalled the beams of moon and sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a star of every one:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mortal builder's most rare device<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could match this winter-palace of ice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas as if every image that mirrored lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his depths serene
through the summer day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each fleeting shadow of earth and sky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the happy model
should be lost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been mimicked in fairy masonry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the elfin builders
of the frost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the hall
are song and laughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheeks of Christmas
grow red and jolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sprouting is every corbel and rafter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lightsome green of
ivy and holly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallows the Yule-log's roaring tide;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad flame-pennons droop and flap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And belly and tug as a
flag in the wind;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunted to death in its
galleries blind;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swift little troops of silent sparks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now pausing, now
scattering away as in fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go threading the soot-forest's tangled darks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like herds of startled
deer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wind
without was eager and sharp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Sir Launfal's gray hair it makes a harp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
rattles and wrings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
icy strings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, in dreary
monotone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Christmas carol of
its own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose burden still, as
he might guess,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was "Shelterless,
shelterless, shelterless!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the seneschal flared like a torch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he shouted the wanderer away from the porch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sat in the gateway and saw all night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great hall-fire, so
cheery and bold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the
window-slits of the castle old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build out its piers of ruddy light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the drift of
the cold.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">PART SECOND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">I.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a
leaf on bush or tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bare boughs rattled shudderingly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river was dumb and could not speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the weaver Winter
its shroud had spun;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single crow on the tree-top bleak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his shining
feathers shed off the cold sun;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it was morning, but shrunk and cold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if her veins were sapless and old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she rose up decrepitly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a last dim look at earth and sea.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">II.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launfal
turned from his own hard gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another heir in his earldom sate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old, bent man, worn out and frail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came back from seeking the Holy Grail;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little he recked of his earldom's loss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But deep in his soul the sign he wore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge of the suffering and the poor.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">III.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launfal's
raiment thin and spare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was idle mail 'gainst the barbed air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it was just at the Christmas time;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he mused, as he sat, of a sunnier clime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sought for a shelter from cold and snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light and warmth of long ago;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees the snake-like caravan crawl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the edge of the desert, black and small,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then nearer and nearer, till, one by one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can count the camels in the sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As over the red-hot sands they pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where, in its slender necklace of grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little spring laughed and leapt in the
shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with its own self like an infant played,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waved its signal of palms.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Christ's
sweet sake, I beg an alms;"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy camels may reach the spring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sir Launfal sees naught save the grewsome
thing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leper, lank as the rain-blanched bone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cowers beside him, a thing as lone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And white as the ice-isles of Northern seas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the desolate horror of his disease.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">V.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sir Launfal
said, "I behold in thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An image of Him who died on the tree;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou also hast had thy crown of thorns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou also hast had the world's buffets and
scorns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to thy life were not denied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds in the hands and feet and side:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mild Mary's Son, acknowledge me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, through him, I give to Thee!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">VI.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the soul of
the leper stood up in his eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked at Sir
Launfal, and straightway he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered in what a haughtier guise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had flung an alms to
leprosie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he caged his young life up in gilded mail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set forth in search of the Holy Grail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart within him was ashes and dust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He parted in twain his single crust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave the leper to eat and drink:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas water out of a
wooden bowl,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'twas red wine he
drank with his thirsty soul.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">VII.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sir Launfal
mused with a downcast face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light shone round about the place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leper no longer crouched at his side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stood before him glorified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining and tall and fair and straight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful
Gate,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself the Gate whereby men can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the temple of God in Man.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">VIII.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words were
shed softer than leaves from the pine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they fell on Sir Launfal as snows on the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, it is I, be not afraid!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many climes, without avail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, it is here,--this cup which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst fill at the streamlet for Me but now;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crust is My body broken for thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water His blood that died on the tree;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the gift without the giver is bare;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself, his hungering neighbor, and Me."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">IX.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launfal awoke
as from a swound:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grail in my castle here is found!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang my idle armor up on the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be the spider's banquet-hall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must be fenced with stronger mail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would seek and find the Holy Grail."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle gate
stands open now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wanderer is
welcome to the hall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hangbird is to the elm-tree bough;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer scowl the
turrets tall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer's long siege at last is o'er;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first poor outcast went in at the door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She entered with him in disguise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mastered the fortress by surprise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no spot she loves so well on ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lingers and smiles there the whole year
round;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meanest serf on Sir Launfal's land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has hall and bower at his command;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's no poor man in the North Countree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is lord of the earldom as much as he.<br>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger came
one night to Yussouf's tent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Behold one outcast and in dread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against whose life the bow of power is bent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who flies, and hath not where to lay his head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to thee for shelter and for food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Yussouf, called through all our tribes 'The
Good.'"</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This tent is
mine," said Yussouf, "but no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than it is God's; come in, and be at peace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freely shalt thou partake of all my store<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I of His who buildeth over these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tents His glorious roof of night and day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at whose door none ever yet heard 'Nay.'"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Yussouf
entertained his guest that night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, waking him ere day, said: "Here is gold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My swiftest horse is saddled for thy flight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart before the prying day grow bold."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one lamp lights another, nor grows less,<br>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That inward light
the stranger's face made grand,<br>

low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his forehead upon Yussouf's hand,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbing: "O,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto that Ibrahim who slew thy son!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take thrice the

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SIDNEY_LANIER"></a>SIDNEY LANIER</p>
<p>Sidney Lanier is a poet of the South who year by year appeals to a
larger number of lovers of good literature. He was born in Georgia of
Huguenot and Scotch ancestry and when only a small lad showed great
talent and love for music. His mother encouraged him in this, and from
beginning with clapping bones it was not long before he learned to play
on the guitar, banjo, violin, and flute. On the Christmas when he was
seven years old he was given a small one-keyed flute, and from that time
on the flute became his favorite instrument. When he grew to manhood he
became first flutist in the Baltimore orchestra. So passionately fond
was he of music that he could scarcely decide between that and poetry as
his choice for a profession.</p>
<p>He was graduated from a Georgia college at the age of eighteen, and
in the following year, 1861, he enlisted in the Southern army. His
younger brother, Clifford, of whom he was very fond, also enlisted, and
when opportunities for promotion came to both they declined rather than
be separated. They engaged in many battles, but Sidney Lanier found
time, even during the war, to continue his study. In 1864 he was taken
prisoner, while doing duty as a signal officer, and spent five months in
Point Lookout prison. He came home from the hardships of war broken in
health, so that from that time on his life was one fierce struggle
against disease.</p>
<p>From the time when as a boy he spent hours in his father's library
reading the tales of King Arthur, the stories of romantic chivalry were
of absorbing interest to him. He understood and loved boys, for he had
four of his own, and for these he has written "The Boy's Froissart,"
"The Boy's King Arthur" and the "Knightly Legends of Wales."</p>
<p>In 1879 he was appointed lecturer on English literature at the Johns
Hopkins University, and his prospects were at last brightening when two
years later he died. During the last seven years of his life, struggling
ever with poverty and pain, he wrote his one volume of poetry. His poems
show his great faith--indeed, his poem, "The Marshes of Glynn," is
religion set to music.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O braided dusks
of the oak and woven shades of the vine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the riotous noonday sun of the June day
long did shine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you
fast in mine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now when the noon is no more, and riot is
rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun is a-wait at the ponderous gate of
the West,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slant yellow beam down the wood aisle
doth seem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a lane into heaven that leads from a
dream,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, now, when my soul all day hath drunken the
soul of the oak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart is at ease from men, and the
wearisome sound of the stroke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the scythe of time
and the trowel of trade is low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And belief overmasters
doubt, and I know that I know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my spirit is grown
to a lordly great compass within,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the length and the breadth and the sweep
of the marshes of Glynn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will work me no fear like the fear they have
wrought me of yore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When length was fatigue, and when breadth was
but bitterness sore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when terror and shrinking and dreary
unnamable pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the
plain,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, now, unafraid, I am fain to face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast, sweet visage
of space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the edge of the wood I am drawn, I am drawn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the gray beach glimmering runs, as a belt
of the dawn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a mete and a mark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the forest dark:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affable live oak, leaning low,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus--with your favor--soft, with a reverent
hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not lightly touching your person, lord of the
land!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending your beauty aside, with a step I stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the firm-packed sand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a world of marsh, that borders a world of
sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the
shimmering band<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sand beach fastens the fringe of the
marsh to the folds of the land.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanishing, swerving, evermore curving again
into sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the sand beach wavers away to a dim gray
looping of light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what if behind me to westward the wall of
the woods stands high?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world lies east: how ample the marsh and
the sea and the sky!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A league and a league of marsh grass,
waist-high, broad in the blade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with
a light or a shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch leisurely off, in a pleasant plain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the terminal blue of the main.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the
terminal sea?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow my soul seems
suddenly free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the weighing of fate and the sad
discussion of sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the length and the breadth and the sweep of
the marshes of Glynn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye marshes, how candid and simple and
nothing-withholding and free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer
yourselves to the sea!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the
rains and the sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye spread and span like the catholic man who
hath mightily won<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God out of knowledge and good out of infinite
pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sight out of blindness and purity out of a
stain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the marsh hen secretly builds on the watery
sod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness
of God!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh
hen flies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt
the marsh and the skies:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By so many roots as the marsh grass sends in
the sod<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness
of God:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, like to the greatness of God is the
greatness within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes
of Glynn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea lends large, as the marsh: lo, out
of his plenty the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours fast: full soon the time of the flood
tide must be:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look how the grace of the sea doth go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About and about through the intricate channels
that flow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here
and there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his waters have flooded the uttermost
creeks and the low-lying lanes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the marsh is meshed with a million veins,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rose-and-silver
evening glow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell,
my lord Sun!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creeks overflow: a thousand rivulets run<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the roots of the sod; the blades of the
marsh grass stir;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward
whir;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passeth, and all is still; and the currents
cease to run;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea and the marsh are one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How still the plains of the waters be!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide is in his ecstasy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide is at its highest height:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
it is night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now from the Vast of the Lord will the
waters of sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll in on the souls of men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who will reveal to our waking ken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forms that swim and the shapes that creep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the waters of sleep?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would I could know what swimmeth below
when the tide comes in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the length and the breadth of the marvelous
marshes of Glynn.</p>

<p>It ill becomes me, Senators of Rome, me, Regulus, after having so
often stood in this venerable assembly, clothed with the supreme dignity
of the republic, to stand before you to-day, a captive,--the captive of
Carthage. Though outwardly free, yet the heaviest of chains, the pledge
of a Roman Consul, makes me the bondsman of the Carthaginians. They have
my promise to return to them in the event of the failure of this their
embassy.</p>
<p>But, Conscript Fathers, Senators, there is but one course to be
pursued. Abandon all thought of peace! Reject the overtures of Carthage!
Reject them wholly and unconditionally! What? What? Give back to her a
thousand able-bodied men, and receive in return this one, attenuated,
war-worn, fever-wasted frame,--this weed, whitened in a dungeon's
darkness, pale and sapless, which no kindness of the sun, no softness of
the summer breeze, can ever restore to life and vigor? It must not,
shall not be! Oh, were Regulus what he was once, before captivity had
unstrung his sinews and enervated his limbs, he might pause; he might
think he were worth a thousand of the foe; he might say, "Make the
exchange, Rome shall not lose by it!" But now, alas, 'tis gone,--that
impetuosity of strength which could once make him a leader indeed, to
penetrate a phalanx, or guide a pursuit. His very armor would be a
burden now! His battlecry would be drowned in the din of onset! His
sword would fall harmless upon his opponents shield!</p>
<p>But if he cannot live, he can at least die, for his country. Do not
deny him this supreme consolation. Consider! Every indignity, every
torture which Carthage shall heap on his dying hours, will be better
than a trumpet's call to your armies. They will remember only Regulus,
their fellow-soldier and their leader. They will forget his defeats.
They will regard only his services to the Republic. Tunis, Sicily,
Sardinia, every well-fought field, won by his blood and theirs, will
flash on their remembrance and kindle their avenging wrath!</p>
<p>And so shall Regulus, though dead, fight as he never fought before
against the foe.</p>
<p>Conscript Fathers, there is another theme,--my family. Forgive the
thought. To you and to Rome, I commit them. I leave no legacy but my
name, no testament but my example.</p>
<p>And you, ambassadors of Carthage, now in this august presence, I
have spoken, not as you expected. I am your captive. Lead me back to
whatever fate may await me. Doubt not that you shall find that to Roman
hearts country is dearer than life, and integrity more precious than
freedom.</p>

Epes Sargent, 1812-1880, was an American author and journalist. For a
number of years he was editor of the "Boston Evening Transcript."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> Regulus was a
celebrated Roman general. As consul he led the Roman forces against the
Carthaginians and defeated them in a number of engagements, but finally
was himself defeated and taken prisoner by the Carthaginians. After five
years of captivity he was sent to Rome to negotiate for peace and an
exchange of prisoners. Though he had been promised his liberty, if the
Romans should accept the treaty, yet when he appeared before the Roman
senate, he denounced the terms most emphatically. Accordingly he
returned to Carthage, where he suffered a cruel death.</p>

RETURN OF REGULUS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ELIJAH KELLOGG</small></p>
<p>The beams of the rising sun had gilded the lofty domes of Carthage,
and given, with its rich and mellow light, a tinge of beauty even to the
frowning ramparts of the outer harbor. Sheltered by the verdant shores,
a hundred triremes were riding proudly at their anchors, their brazen
beaks glittering in the sun, their streamers dancing in the morning
breeze, while many a shattered plank and timber gave evidence of
desperate conflict with the fleets of Rome.</p>
<p>No murmur of business or of revelry arose from the city. The artisan
had forsaken his shop, the judge his tribunal, the priest the sanctuary,
and even the stern stoic had come forth from his retirement to mingle
with the crowd that, anxious and agitated, were rushing toward the
senate-house, startled by the report that Regulus had returned to
Carthage.</p>
<p>Onward, still onward, trampling each other under foot, they rushed,
furious with anger, and eager for revenge. Fathers were there, whose
sons were groaning in fetters; maidens, whose lovers, weak and wounded,
were dying in the dungeons of Rome, and gray-haired men and matrons,
whom the Roman sword had left childless.</p>
<p>But when the stern features of Regulus were seen, and his colossal
form towering above the ambassadors who had returned with him from Rome;
when the news passed from lip to lip that the dreaded warrior, so far
from advising the Roman senate to consent to an exchange of prisoners,
had urged them to pursue, with exterminating vengeance, Carthage and
Carthaginians,--the multitude swayed to and fro like a forest beneath a
tempest, and the rage and hate of that tumultuous throng vented itself
in groans, and curses, and yells of vengeance.</p>
<p>But calm, cold, and immovable as the marble walls around him, stood
the Roman; and he stretched out his hand over that frenzied crowd, with
gesture as proudly commanding as though he still stood at the head of
the gleaming cohorts of Rome. The tumult ceased; the curse, half
muttered, died upon the lip; and so intense was the silence, that the
clanking of the brazen manacles upon the wrists of the captive fell
sharp and full upon every ear in that vast assembly, as he thus
addressed them:--</p>
<p>"Ye doubtless thought--for ye judge of Roman virtue by your
own--that I would break my plighted oath, rather than, returning, brook
your vengeance. I might give reasons for this, in Punic comprehension,
most foolish act of mine. I might speak of those eternal principles
which make death for one's country a pleasure, not a pain. But, by great
Jupiter! methinks I should debase myself to talk of such high things to
you; to you, expert in womanly inventions; to you, well-skilled to drive
a treacherous trade with simple Africans for ivory and gold!</p>
<p>"If the bright blood that fills my veins, transmitted free from
godlike ancestry, were like that slimy ooze which stagnates in your
arteries, I had remained at home, and broke my plighted oath to save my
life. I am a Roman citizen; therefore have I returned, that ye might
work your will upon this mass of flesh and bones, that I esteem no
higher than the rags that cover them.</p>
<p>"Here, in your capital, do I defy you. Have I not conquered your
armies, fired your towns, and dragged your generals at my chariot
wheels, since first my youthful arms could wield a spear? And do you
think to see me crouch and cower before a tamed and shattered senate?
The tearing of flesh and rending of sinews is but pastime compared with
the mental agony that heaves my frame.</p>
<p>"The moon has scarce yet waned since the proudest of Rome's proud
matrons, the mother upon whose breast I slept, and whose fair brow so
oft had bent over me before the noise of battle had stirred my blood, or
the fierce toil of war nerved my sinews, did, with fondest memory of
bygone hours, entreat me to remain. I have seen her, who, when my
country called me to the field, did buckle on my harness with trembling
hands, while the tears fell thick and fast down the hard corselet
scales--I have seen her tear her gray locks and beat her aged breast, as
on her knees she begged me not to return to Carthage! and all the
assembled senate of Rome, grave and reverend men, proffered the same
request. The puny torments which ye have in store to welcome me withal,
shall be, to what I have endured, even as the murmur of a summer's brook
to the fierce roar of angry surges on a rocky beach.</p>
<p>"Last night, as I lay fettered in my dungeon, I heard a strange,
ominous sound; it seemed like the distant march of some vast army, their
harness clanging as they marched, when suddenly there stood by me
Xanthippus, the Spartan general, by whose aid you conquered me, and,
with a voice as low as when the solemn wind moans through the leaflless
forest, he thus addressed me:--</p>
<p>"'Roman, I come to bid thee curse, with thy dying breath, this fated
city: know that in an evil moment, the Carthaginian generals, furious
with rage that I had conquered thee, their conqueror, did basely murder
me. And then they thought to stain my brightest honor. But, for this
foul deed, the wrath of Jove shall rest upon them here and hereafter.'
And then he vanished.</p>
<p>"And now, go bring your sharpest torments. The woes I see impending
over this guilty realm shall be enough to sweeten death, though every
nerve and artery were a shooting pang. I die! but my death shall prove a
proud triumph; and, for every drop of blood ye from my veins do draw,
your own shall flow in rivers.</p>
<p>"Woe to thee, Carthage! Woe to the proud city of the waters! I see
thy nobles wailing at the feet of Roman senators! thy citizens in
terror! thy ships in flames! I hear the victorious shouts of Rome! I see
her eagles glittering on thy ramparts. Proud city, thou art doomed! The
curse of God is on thee--a clinging, wasting curse. It shall not leave
thy gates till hungry flames shall lick the fretted gold from off thy
proud palaces, and every brook runs crimson to the sea."</p>

TO THE GLADIATORS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ELIJAH KELLOGG</small></p>
<p>It had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lentulus, returning with
victorious eagles, had amused the populace with the sports of the
amphitheatre to an extent hitherto unknown even in that luxurious city.
The shouts of revelry had died away; the roar of the lion had ceased;
the last loiterer had retired from the banquet, and the lights in the
palace of the victor were extinguished. The moon, piercing the tissue of
fleecy clouds, silvered the dewdrop on the corselet of the Roman
sentinel, and tipped the dark waters of Volturnus with wavy, tremulous
light. It was a night of holy calm, when the zephyr sways the young
spring leaves, and whispers among the hollow reeds its dreamy music. No
sound was heard but the last sob of some weary wave, telling its story
to the smooth pebbles of the beach, and then all was still as the breast
when the spirit has departed.</p>
<p>In the deep recesses of the amphitheatre a band of gladiators were
crowded together,--their muscles still knotted with the agony of
conflict, the foam upon their lips, and the scowl of battle yet
lingering upon their brows,--when Spartacus, rising in the midst of that
grim assemblage, thus addressed them:--</p>
<p>"Ye call me chief, and ye do well to call him chief who, for twelve
long years, has met upon the arena every shape of man or beast that the
broad Empire of Rome could furnish, and yet never has lowered his arm.
And if there be one among you who can say that, ever, in public fight or
private brawl, my actions did belie my tongue, let him step forth and
say it. If there be three in all your throng dare face me on the bloody
sand, let them come on!</p>
<p>"Yet, I was not always thus, a hired butcher, a savage chief of
savage men. My father was a reverent man, who feared great Jupiter, and
brought to the rural deities his offerings of fruits and flowers. He
dwelt among the vineclad rocks and olive groves at the foot of Helicon.
My early life ran quiet as the brook by which I sported. I was taught to
prune the vine, to tend the flock; and then, at noon, I gathered my
sheep beneath the shade, and played upon the shepherd's flute. I had a
friend, the son of our neighbor; we led our flocks to the same pasture,
and shared together our rustic meal.</p>
<p>"One evening, after the sheep were folded, and we were all seated
beneath the myrtle that shaded our cottage, my grandsire, an old man,
was telling of Marathon and Leuctra, and how, in ancient times, a little
band of Spartans, in a defile of the mountains, withstood a whole army.
I did not then know what war meant; but my cheeks burned. I knew not
why; and I clasped the knees of that venerable man, till my mother,
parting the hair from off my brow, kissed my throbbing temples, and bade
me go to rest, and think no more of those old tales and savage wars.</p>
<p>"That very night the Romans landed on our shore, and the clash of
steel was heard within our quiet vale. I saw the breast that had
nourished me trampled by the iron hoof of the warhorse; the bleeding
body of my father flung amid the blazing rafters of our dwelling. To-day
I killed a man in the arena, and when I broke his helmet clasps, behold!
he was my friend! He knew me,--smiled faintly,--gasped,--and died; the
same sweet smile that I had marked upon his face when, in adventurous
boyhood, we scaled some lofty cliff to pluck the first ripe grapes, and
bear them home in childish triumph. I told the praetor he was my friend,
noble and brave, and I begged his body, that I might burn it upon the
funeral-pile, and mourn over him. Ay, on my knees, amid the dust and
blood of the arena, I begged that boon, while all the Roman maids and
matrons, and those holy virgins they call vestal, and the rabble,
shouted in mockery, deeming it rare sport, forsooth, to see Rome's
fiercest gladiator turn pale, and tremble like a very child, before that
piece of bleeding clay; but the praetor drew back as if I were
pollution, and sternly said, 'Let the carrion rot! There are no noble
men but Romans!' And he, deprived of funeral rites, must wander, a
hapless ghost, beside the waters of that sluggish river, and look--and
look--and look in vain to the bright Elysian Fields where dwell his
ancestors and noble kindred. And so must you, and so must I, die like
dogs!</p>
<p>"O Rome! Rome! thou hast been a tender nurse to me! Ay, thou hast
given to that poor, gentle, timid shepherd-lad, who never knew a harsher
sound than a flute-note, muscles of iron and a heart of flint; taught
him to drive the sword through rugged brass and plaited mail, and warm
it in the marrow of his foe! to gaze into the glaring eyeballs of the
fierce Numidian lion, even as a smooth-cheeked boy upon a laughing girl.
And he shall pay thee back till thy yellow Tiber is red as frothing
wine, and in its deepest ooze thy life-blood lies curdled!</p>
<p>"Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are! the strength of brass is
in your toughened sinews; but to-morrow some Roman Adonis, breathing
sweet odors from his curly locks, shall come, and with his lily fingers
pat your brawny shoulders, and bet his sesterces upon your blood! Hark!
Hear ye yon lion roaring in his den? 'Tis three days since he tasted
meat; but to-morrow he shall break his fast upon your flesh; and ye
shall be a dainty meal for him.</p>
<p>"If ye are brutes, then stand here like fat oxen waiting for the
butcher's knife; if ye are men, follow me! strike down yon sentinel, and
gain the mountain passes, and there do bloody work as did your sires at
old Thermopyl&aelig;! Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian spirit frozen
in your veins, that you do crouch and cower like base-born slaves
beneath your master's lash? O comrades! warriors! Thracians! if we must
fight, let us fight for ourselves; if we must slaughter, let us
slaughter our oppressors; if we must die, let us die under the open sky,
by the bright waters, in noble, honorable battle."</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>
This is a supposed speech of Spartacus written by Elijah Kellogg, a New
England clergyman. Spartacus was a Thracian by birth, who served in the
Roman army. Having deserted, he was taken prisoner, sold as a slave, and
trained as a gladiator at Capua. He escaped and gathered about him a
large army of slaves and gladiators, with whom he intended to push
northward and allow them all to return to their homes. They, however,
after attacking many towns, were finally overcome. Spartacus himself
died in battle, and six thousand slaves were crucified on the road from
Capua to Rome.</p>
<p>Capua was a city of great luxury, containing an amphitheater nearly
as large as the Coliseum at Rome. The ancients attached great importance
to the rites of burial, and believed that the soul could not reach the
Elysian Fields unless the body had been buried.</p>

BEFORE BIRTH</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>TRANSLATED FROM SALLUST</small></p>
<p>You have committed to my conduct, O Romans, the war against
Jugurtha. The patricians take offence. They say, "Why, he has no family
statues. He can point to no illustrious ancestors." What of that? Will
dead ancestors or motionless statues fight battles? Can your general
appeal to them in the hour of extremest danger? How wise it would be,
surely, to intrust your army to some untried person without a single
scar, but with any number of ancestral statues,--who knows not the
simplest rudiments of military service, but is very perfect in pedigree!
I have known such holiday heroes, raised, because of family, to
positions for which they had no fitness. But, then, in the moment of
action they were obliged, in their ignorance and trepidation, to intrust
every movement, even the most simple, to some subaltern, some despised
plebeian.</p>
<p>What they have seen in books, I have seen written on battlefields,
with steel and blood. They sneer at my mean origin. Where,--and may the
gods bear witness,--where, but in the spirit of man, is nobility lodged?
Tell these despicable railers that their haughty lineage cannot make
them noble, nor will my humble birth make me base. I profess no
indifference to noble descent; but when a descendant is dwarfed in the
comparison, it should be a shame, and not a matter to boast of! I can
show the standards, the armor, and the spoils which I have in person
wrested from the vanquished. I can show the scars of many wounds
received in combating the enemies of Rome. These are my statues! These
are my honors, to boast of; not inherited by accident, but earned by
toil, by abstinence, by valor, amid clouds of dust and seas of blood.
Their titles date from similar acts of their ancestors; but these
detractors did not even dare to appear on the field as spectators. These
are my credentials! These, O Romans, are my titles of nobility! Tell me,
are they not as deserving of your confidence and reward as those of
which any patrician of them all can boast?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span>&nbsp;Sallust,
the author of this selection, was a famous Roman historian of the first
century B. C. Caius Marius was the son of a small farmer and worked his
way up from this humble origin to the highest position, that of consul,
in spite of the determined opposition of the senate, and the
aristocracy. By the vote of the Roman people, he was given command of
the army in the campaign against Jugurtha, a prince who had usurped the
Numidian throne.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls on a slave!--not such as, swept along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the full tide of power, the conqueror leads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crimson glory and undying fame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But base, ignoble slaves--slaves to a horde<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of petty tyrants; feudal despots; lords,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich in some dozen paltry villages,<br>

Each hour dark fraud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or open rapine, or protected murder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry out against them. But this very day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An honest man, my neighbor--there he stands--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was struck--struck like a dog, by one who wore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge of Ursini, because, forsooth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tossed not high his ready cap in air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suffer such dishonor?--Men, and wash not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stain away in blood?</p>

shames are common.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known deeper wrongs. I that speak to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a brother once, a gracious boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of gentleness, of calmest hope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sweet and quiet joy: there was the look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven upon his face, which limners give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beloved disciple. How I loved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother at once and son! He left my side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summer bloom on his fair cheek, a smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parting his innocent lips: in one short hour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For vengeance!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rouse ye,
Romans! rouse ye, slaves!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have ye brave sons? Look in the next fierce
brawl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see them live, torn from your arms,
distained,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dishonored; and, if ye dare call for justice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be answered by the lash!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sat on her seven hills, and from her throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beauty ruled the world! Yet we are Romans!<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="EMMETS_VINDICATION"></a>EMMET'S
VINDICATION</p>
<p>MY LORDS: What have I to say why sentence of death should not be
pronounced on me, according to law? I have nothing to say that can alter
your predetermination, nor that it will become me to say with any view
to the mitigation of that sentence which you are here to pronounce, and
I must abide by. But I have that to say which interests me more than
life, and which you have labored to destroy. I have much to say why my
reputation should be rescued from the load of false accusation and
calumny which has been heaped upon it.</p>
<p>Were I only to suffer death, after being adjudged guilty by <i>your</i>
tribunal, I should bow in silence, and meet the fate that awaits me
without a murmur; but the sentence of law which delivers my body to the
executioner will, through the ministry of that law, labor, in its own
vindication, to consign my character to obloquy; for there must be guilt
somewhere--whether in the sentence of the court, or in the catastrophe,
posterity must determine. The man dies, but his memory lives. That mine
may not perish--that it may live in the respect of my countrymen--I
seize upon this opportunity to vindicate myself from some of the charges
alleged against me.</p>
<p>When my spirit shall be wafted to a more friendly port; when my
shade shall have joined the bands of those martyred heroes who have shed
their blood, on the scaffold and in the field, in defense of their
country and virtue; this is my hope--I wish that my memory and name may
animate those who survive me, while I look down with complacency on the
destruction of that perfidious government which upholds its domination
by blasphemy of the Most High, which displays its powers over man as
over the beasts of the forest, which sets man upon his brother, and
lifts his hand, in the name of God, against the throat of his fellow who
believes or doubts a little more or less than the government standard--a
government which is steeled to barbarity by the cries of the orphans and
the tears of the widows which its cruelty has made.</p>
<p>I swear by the throne of Heaven, before which I must shortly
appear--by the blood of the murdered patriots who have gone before
me--that my conduct has been, through all this peril and all my
purposes, governed only by the convictions which I have uttered, and no
other view than that of the emancipation of my country from the
superinhuman oppression under which she has so long and too patiently
travailed; and that I confidently and assuredly hope, wild and
chimerical as it may appear, that there is still union and strength in
Ireland to accomplish this noble enterprise.</p>
<p>My country was my idol. To it I sacrificed every selfish, every
endearing sentiment; and for it I now offer up my life! I acted as an
Irishman, determined on delivering my country from the yoke of a foreign
and unrelenting tyranny, and from the more galling yoke of a domestic
faction, its joint partner and perpetrator in the patricide, whose
reward is the ignominy of existing with an exterior of splendor and a
consciousness of depravity. It was the wish of my heart to extricate my
country from this doubly riveted despotism. I wished to place her
independence beyond the reach of any power on earth. I wished to exalt
her to that proud station in the world which Providence had fitted her
to fill.</p>
<p>Let no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me with dishonor; let no
man attaint my memory by believing that I could have engaged in any
cause but that of my country's liberty and independence, or that I could
have become the pliant minion of power in the oppression or the miseries
of my countrymen. I would not have submitted to a foreign oppressor, for
the same reason that I would resist the domestic tyrant; in the dignity
of freedom I would have fought upon the threshold of my country, and her
enemies should enter only by passing over my lifeless corpse. Am I, who
lived but for my country, and who have subjected myself to the vengeance
of the jealous and wrathful oppressor, and to the bondage of the grave,
only to give my countrymen their rights and my country her
independence--am I to be loaded with calumny, and not to be suffered to
resent or repel it? No! God forbid!</p>
<p>If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the concerns
and cares of those who are dear to them in this transitory life, O ever
dear and venerated shade of my departed father, look down with scrutiny
on the conduct of your suffering son, and see if I have even for a
moment deviated from those principles of morality and patriotism which
it was your care to instill into my youthful mind, and for an adherence
to which I am now to offer up my life!</p>
<p>My Lords, you are all impatient for the sacrifice. The blood which
you seek is not congealed by the artificial terrors which surround your
victim; it circulates warmly and unruffled through the channels which
God created for noble purposes, but which you are bent to destroy, for
purposes so grievous that they cry to Heaven!</p>
<p>Be ye patient; I have but a few words more to say. I am going to my
silent grave; my lamp of life is nearly extinguished; my race is run;
the grave opens to receive me, and I sink into its bosom. I have but one
request to ask at my departure from this world--it is the charity of its
silence. Let no man write my epitaph; for, as no one who knows my
motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse
them. Let them and me repose in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain
uninscribed, until other times and other men can do justice to my
character. When my country shall take her place among the nations of the
earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written! I have done.</p>

the latter part of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the
nineteenth, the spirit of independence was abroad. The American
Revolution was followed by the French Revolution, and in 1803 Robert
Emmet, an Irish patriot, headed a band to gain independence for Ireland.
After an unsuccessful attempt to take the arsenal and castle at Dublin,
he fled to the Wicklow mountains, whence he planned to escape to the
continent. Contrary to the advice of his friends, he determined to have
a last interview with his sweetheart, but the delay proved fatal to him.
He was seized and condemned to death. This extract is from the

<p>Think of the country for which the Indians fought. Who can blame
them? As Philip looked down from his seat on Mount Hope, that glorious
eminence, that</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"----throne of royal
state, which far<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,"--</p>
<p>as he looked down, and beheld the lovely scene which spread beneath,
at a summer sunset, the distant hill-tops glittering as with fire, the
slanting beams streaming across the waters, the broad plains, the island
groups, the majestic forest,--could he be blamed, if his heart burned
within him, as he beheld it all passing, by no tardy process, from
beneath his control, into the hands of the stranger?</p>
<p>As the river chieftains--the lords of the waterfalls and the
mountains--ranged this lovely valley, can it be wondered at, if they
beheld with bitterness the forest disappearing beneath the settler's
ax--the fishing-place disturbed by his saw-mills? Can we not fancy the
feelings with which some strong-minded savage, the chief of the
Pocomtuck Indians, who should have ascended the summit of the Sugar-loaf
Mountain (rising as it does before us, at this moment, in all its
loveliness and grandeur),--in company with a friendly
settler,--contemplating the progress already made by the white man, and
marking the gigantic strides with which he was advancing into the
wilderness, should fold his arms and say, "White man, there is eternal
war between me and thee! I quit not the land of my fathers, but with my
life. In those woods, where I bent my youthful bow, I will still hunt
the deer; over yonder waters I will still glide, unrestrained, in my
bark canoe. By those dashing waterfalls I will still lay up my winter's
store of food; on these fertile meadows I will still plant my corn.</p>
<p>"Stranger, the land is mine! I understand not these paper rights. I
gave not my consent, when, as thou sayest, these broad regions were
purchased, for a few baubles, of my fathers. They could sell what was
theirs; they could sell no more. How could my fathers sell that which
the Great Spirit sent me into the world to live upon? They knew not what
they did.</p>
<p>"The stranger came, a timid suppliant,--few and feeble, and asked to
lie down on the red man's bear-skin, and warm himself at the red man's
fire, and have a little piece of land to raise corn for his women and
children; and now he is become strong, and mighty, and bold, and spreads
out his parchments over the whole, and says, 'It is mine.'</p>
<p>"Stranger! there is not room for us both. The Great Spirit has not
made us to live together. There is poison in the white man's cup; the
white man's dog barks at the red man's heels. If I should leave the land
of my fathers, whither shall I fly? Shall I go to the south, and dwell
among the graves of the Pequots? Shall I wander to the west, the fierce
Mohawk,--the man-eater,--is my foe. Shall I fly to the east, the great
water is before me. No, stranger; here I have lived, and here will I
die; and if here thou abidest, there is eternal war between, me and thee.</p>
<p>"Thou hast taught me thy arts of destruction; for that alone I thank
thee. And now take heed to thy steps; the red man is thy foe. When thou
goest forth by day, my bullet shall whistle past thee; when thou liest
down by night, my knife is at thy throat. The noonday sun shall not
discover thy enemy, and the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy
rest. Thou shalt plant in terror, and I will reap in blood; thou shalt
sow the earth with corn, and I will strew it with ashes; thou shalt go
forth with the sickle, and I will follow after with the scalping-knife;
thou shalt build, and I will burn,--till the white man or the Indian
perish from the land. Go thy way for this time in safety,--but remember,
stranger, <i>there is eternal war between me and thee!</i>"</p>

CAPTURE OF QUEBEC <br>
<small>(From "Montcalm and Wolfe.")</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>FRANCIS PARKMAN<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>The sun rose, and, from the ramparts of Quebec, the astonished
people saw the Plains of Abraham glittering with arms, and the dark-red
lines of the English forming in array of battle. Breathless messengers
had borne the evil tidings to Montcalm, and far and near his
wide-extended camp resounded with the rolling of alarm drums and the din
of startled preparation.</p>
<p>He, too, had had his struggles and his sorrows. The civil power had
thwarted him; famine, discontent, and disaffection were rife among his
soldiers; and no small portion of the Canadian militia had dispersed
from sheer starvation. In spite of all, he had trusted to hold out till
the winter frosts should drive the invaders from before the town; when,
on that disastrous morning, the news of their successful temerity fell
like a cannon-shot upon his ear.</p>
<p>Still he assumed a tone of confidence. "They have got to the weak
side of us at last," he is reported to have said, "and we must crush
them with our numbers." With headlong haste, his troops were pouring
over the bridge of the St. Charles, and gathering in heavy masses under
the western ramparts of the town. Could numbers give assurance of
success, their triumph would have been secure; for five French
battalions and the armed colonial peasantry amounted in all to more than
seven thousand five hundred men.</p>
<p>Full in sight before them stretched the long, thin lines of the
British forces, the half-wild Highlanders, the steady soldiery of
England, and the hardy levies of the provinces,--less than five thousand
in number, but all inured to battle, and strong in the full assurance of
success.</p>
<p>Yet, could the chiefs of that gallant army have pierced the secrets
of the future, could they have foreseen that the victory which they
burned to achieve would have robbed England of her proudest boast, that
the conquest of Canada would pave the way for the independence of
America, their swords would have dropped from their hands, and the
heroic fire have gone out within their hearts.</p>
<p>It was nine o'clock, and the adverse armies stood motionless, each
gazing on the other. The clouds hung low, and, at intervals, warm light
showers descended, besprinkling both alike. The coppice and cornfields
in front of the British troops were filled with French sharp-shooters,
who kept up a distant, spattering fire. Here and there a soldier fell in
the ranks, and the gap was filled in silence.</p>
<p>At a little before ten, the British could see that Montcalm was
preparing to advance, and, in a few moments, all his troops appeared in
rapid motion. They came on in three divisions, shouting after the manner
of their nation, and firing heavily as soon as they came within range.</p>
<p>In the British ranks, not a trigger was pulled, not a soldier
stirred; and their ominous composure seemed to damp the spirits of the
assailants. It was not till the French were within forty yards that the
fatal word was given, and the British muskets blazed forth at once in
one crashing explosion. Like a ship at full career, arrested with sudden
ruin on a sunken rock, the ranks of Montcalm staggered, shivered, and
broke before that wasting storm of lead.</p>
<p>The smoke, rolling along the field, for a moment shut out the view;
but when the white wreaths were scattered on the wind, a wretched
spectacle was disclosed; men and officers tumbled in heaps, battalions
resolved into a mob, order and obedience gone; and when the British
muskets were leveled for a second volley, the masses of the militia were
seen to cower and shrink with uncontrollable panic.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, the French regulars stood their ground, returning
a sharp and not ineffectual fire. But now, echoing cheer on cheer,
redoubling volley on volley, trampling the dying and the dead, and
driving the fugitives in crowds, the British troops advanced and swept
the field before them. The ardor of the men burst all restraint. They
broke into a run, and with unsparing slaughter chased the flying
multitude to the gates of Quebec. Foremost of all, the light-footed
Highlanders dashed along in furious pursuit, hewing down the Frenchmen
with their broadswords, and slaying many in the very ditch of the
fortifications. Never was victory more quick or more decisive.</p>

AND HER COLONIES</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>EDMUND BURKE<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>England's hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows
from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and
equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as
strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their
civil rights associated with your government; they will cling and
grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them
from their allegiance. But let it once be understood that your
government may be one thing, and their privileges another; that these
two things may exist without any mutual relation--the cement is gone;
the cohesion is loosened; and everything hastens to decay and
dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign
authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple
consecrated to our common faith; wherever the chosen race and sons of
England worship freedom, they will turn their faces toward you. The more
they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they
love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can
have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it
from Spain; they may have it from Prussia; but, until you become lost to
all feelings of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom
they can have from none but you. This is the commodity of price of which
you have the monopoly. This is the true Act of Navigation, which binds
to you the commerce of the colonies, and through them secures to you the
wealth of the world. Deny them this participation of freedom, and you
break that sole bond which originally made, and must still preserve, the
unity of the empire. Do not entertain so weak an imagination as that
your registers and your bonds, your affidavits and your sufferances,
are what form the great securities of your commerce. Do not dream that
your letters of office, and your instructions, and your suspending
clauses, are the things that hold together the great contexture of this
mysterious whole. These things do not make your government. Dead
instruments, passive tools as they are, it is the spirit of the English
communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the
spirit of the English constitution, which, infused through the mighty
mass, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies every part of the
empire, even down to the minutest member. Is it not the same virtue
which does everything for us here in England?</p>
<p>Do you imagine, then, that it is the land tax which raises your
revenue? That it is the annual vote in the committee of supply which
gives you your army? Or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires it
with bravery and discipline? No! surely no! It is the love of the
people; it is their attachment to their government, from the sense of
the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution, which gives you
your army and your navy, and infuses into both that liberal obedience
without which your army would be a base rabble and your navy nothing but
rotten timber.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_WAY_TO_WEALTH"></a>THE WAY
TO WEALTH</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>COURTEOUS READER: I have heard that nothing gives an author so great
pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by others. Judge,
then, how much I must have been gratified by an incident I am going to
relate to you.</p>
<p>I stopped my horse, lately, where a great number of people were
collected at an auction of merchants' goods. The hour of the sale not
being come, they were conversing on the badness of the times; and one of
the company called to a plain, clean old man, with white locks: "Pray,
Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not these heavy taxes
quite ruin the country? How shall we ever be able to pay them? What
would you advise us to do?"</p>
<p>Father Abraham stood up and replied: "If you would have my advice, I
will give it to you in short; for 'a word to the wise is enough,' as
Poor Richard says." They joined in desiring him to speak his mind, and,
gathering around him, he proceeded as follows: "Friends," said he, "the
taxes are indeed very heavy; and, if those laid on by the Government
were the only ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them;
but we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us.</p>
<p>"We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by
our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and of these taxes the
commissioners can not ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement.
However, let us hearken to good advice, and something may be done for
us. 'Heaven helps them that help themselves,' as Poor Richard says.</p>
<p>"It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people
one tenth part of their time to be employed in its service; but idleness
taxes many of us much more; sloth, by bringing on diseases, absolutely
shortens life. 'Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears;
while the used key is always bright,' as Poor Richard says. How much
more than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting that 'the
sleeping fox catches no poultry,' and that there will be sleeping enough
in the grave.</p>
<p>"'Lost time is never found again; and what we call time enough,
always proves little enough.' Let us, then, be up and doing, and doing
to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity.
'Drive thy business, and let not that drive thee'; and 'early to bed,
and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,' as Poor
Richard says.</p>
<p>"So, what signifies wishing and hoping for better times? We may make
these times better if we bestir ourselves. 'Industry need not wish, and
he that lives upon hopes will die fasting.' 'There are no gains without
pains; then help hands, for I have no lands.' 'He that hath a trade,
hath an estate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and
honor'; but then the trade must be worked at, and the calling well
followed, or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our
taxes. Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may
be hindered to-morrow. 'One to-day is worth two to-morrows,' as Poor
Richard says; and further, 'Never leave that till to-morrow which you
can do to-day.'</p>
<p>"If you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a good master
should catch you idle? Are you, then, your own master? Be ashamed to
catch yourself idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself, your
family, and your country. It is true, there is much to be done, and
perhaps you are weak-handed; but stick to it steadily, and you will see
great effects; for 'constant dropping wears away stones,' and 'little
strokes fell great oaks.'</p>
<p>"But with our industry we must likewise be steady, settled, and
careful, and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not trust
too much to others; for, as Poor Richard says, 'Three removes are as bad
as a fire'; and again, 'Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee'; and
again, 'If you would have your business done, go; if not, send'; and
again, 'The eye of the master will do more work than both his hands';
and again, 'Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge.'</p>
<p>"So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own
business; but to these we must add frugality, if we would make our
industry more certainly successful. A man may, if he knows not how to
save as he gets, keep his nose to the grindstone all his life, and die
not worth a groat at last. 'If you would be wealthy, think of saving as
well as of getting.'</p>
<p>"Away with your expensive follies, and you will not then have so
much cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable
families; for 'what maintains one vice would bring up two children.'
Beware of little expenses. 'Many a little makes a mickle'; 'A small leak
will sink a great ship.' Here you are all got together at this sale of
fineries and knickknacks. You call them goods, but, if you do not take
care, they will prove evils to some of you.</p>
<p>"You expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may be, for
less than cost; but, if you have no occasion for them, they must be dear
to you. Remember what Poor Richard says: 'Buy what thou hast no need of,
and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.' 'Silks, satins, scarlet,
and velvets put out the kitchen fire.' These are not the necessaries of
life; they can scarcely be called the conveniences; and yet, only
because they look pretty, how many want to have them!</p>
<p>"By these and other extravagances, the greatest are reduced to
poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but
who, through industry and frugality, have maintained their standing. 'If
you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some; for he
that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing'; and, indeed, so does he that
lends to such people, when he goes to get it again.</p>
<p>"It is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog
to swell in order to equal the ox. After all, this pride of appearance
can not promote health, nor ease pain; it makes no increase of merit in
the person; it creates envy; it hastens misfortunes.</p>
<p>"But what madness it must be to run in debt for superfluities! Think
what you do when you run in debt: you give to another power over your
liberty. If you can not pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see your
creditor; you will be in fear when you speak to him; you will make poor,
pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by degrees come to lose your veracity,
and sink into base, downright lying; for 'the second vice is lying, the
first is running in debt,' as Poor Richard says; and again, 'Lying rides
upon debt's back.'</p>
<p>"This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom; but industry, and
frugality, and prudence may all be blasted without the blessing of
Heaven. Therefore ask that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to
those that at present seem to want it, but comfort and help them."</p>
<p>The old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and
approved the doctrine, and immediately practiced the contrary, just as
if it had been a common sermon; for the auction opened, and they began
to buy extravagantly. I found the good man had thoroughly studied my
almanac, and digested all I had dropped on these topics during the
course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me must
have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with
it, though I was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my
own which he ascribed to me, but rather the gleanings that I had made of
the sense of all ages and nations.</p>
<p>However, I resolved to be the better for the echo of it; and,
although I had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat, I went
away resolved to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt
do the same, thy profit will be as great as mine.--I am, as ever, thine
to serve thee.</p>

which he has the following to say in his Autobiography: "In 1732, I

the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly
such as inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procuring
wealth, and thereby securing virtue. These proverbs, which contained the
wisdom of many ages and nations, I assembled and formed into a connected
discourse, prefixed to the Almanac of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old
man to the people attending an auction. The bringing all these scattered
counsels thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression."</p>

RESOLUTION TO PUT VIRGINIA INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>BY PATRICK HENRY<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT,--No man thinks more highly than I do of the
patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have
just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject
in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought
disrespectful to those gentlemen, if, entertaining, as I do, opinions of
a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments
freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question
before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own
part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or
slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be
the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to
arrive at truth, and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to
God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time,
through fear of giving offence, I should consider myself as guilty of
treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty towards the
Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of
hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to
the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the
part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,
and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their
temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,
I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide
for it.</p>
<p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the
lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the
past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the
conduct of the British Ministry for the last ten years to justify those
hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and
the House? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been
lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.
Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how
this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike
preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and
armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown
ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to
win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the
implements of war and subjugation--the last arguments to which kings
resort. I ask, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not
to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible
motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the
world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir,
she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for no other.
They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the
British Ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose
to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the
last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing.
We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but
it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble
supplication? What terms shall we find, which have not been already
exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer.
Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which
is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have
supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have
implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the
Ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our
remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our
supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with
contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may
we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer
any room for hope. If we wish to be free--if we mean to preserve
inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long
contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which
we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never
to abandon, until the glorious abject of our contest shall be
obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to
arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us!</p>
<p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the
next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed,
and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we
gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means
of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the
delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and
foot?</p>
<p>Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which
the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people,
armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which
we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against
us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just
God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up
friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the
strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides,
sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now
too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in
submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be
heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I
repeat it, sir, let it come!</p>
<p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry,
Peace, peace!--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The
next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of
resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we
here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life
so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains
and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may
take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>EDWARD EVERETT HALE<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>I first came to understand anything about "the man without a
country" one day when we over-hauled a dirty little schooner which had
slaves on board. An officer was sent to take charge of her, and, after a
few minutes, he sent back his boat to ask that someone might be sent him
who could talk Portuguese. But none of the officers did; and just as the
captain was sending forward to ask if any of the people could, Nolan
stepped out and said he should be glad to interpret, if the captain
wished, as he understood the language. The captain thanked him, fitted
out another boat with him, and in this boat it was my luck to go.</p>
<p>There were not a great many of the negroes; most of them were out of
the hold and swarming all round the dirty deck, with a central throng
surrounding Vaughan. "Tell them they are free, Nolan," said Vaughan;
"and tell them that I will take them all to Cape Palmas."</p>
<p>Cape Palmas was practically as far from the homes of most of them as
New Orleans or Rio Janeiro was; that is, they would be eternally
separated from home there. And their interpreters, as we could
understand, instantly said, "Ah, non Palmas." The drops stood on poor
Nolan's white forehead, as he hushed the men down, and said:</p>
<p>"He says, 'Not Palmas.' He says, 'Take us home, take us to our own
country, take us to our own house, take us to our own pickaninnies and
our own women.' He says he has an old father and mother who will die if
they do not see him. And this one says," choked out Nolan, "that he has
not heard a word from, his home in six months."</p>
<p>Even the negroes stopped howling, as they saw Nolan's agony, and
Vaughan's almost equal agony of sympathy. As quick as he could get
words, Vaughan said:</p>
<p>"Tell them, yes, yes, yes; tell them they shall go to the Mountains
of the Moon, if they will."</p>
<p>And after some fashion Nolan said so. And then they all fell to
kissing him again.</p>
<p>But he could not stand it long; and getting Vaughan to say he might
go back, he beckoned me down into our boat. As we lay back in the
stern-sheets and the men gave way, he said to me: "Youngster, let that
show you what it is to be without a family, without a home, and without
a country. And if you are ever tempted to say a word or to do a thing
that shall put a bar between you and your family, your home, and your
country, pray God in his mercy to take you that instant home to his own
heaven. Think of your home, boy; write and read, and talk about it. Let
it be nearer and nearer to your thought, the farther you have to travel
from it; and rush back to it when you are free, as that poor black slave
is doing now. And for your country, boy," and the words rattled in his
throat, "and for that flag," and he pointed to the ship, "never dream a
dream but of serving her as she bids you, though the service carry you
through a thousand terrors. No matter what happens to you, no matter who
flatters you or who abuses you, never look at another flag. Remember,
that behind all these men you have to do with,--behind officers, and
government, and people even--there is the Country Herself, your Country,
and that you belong to Her as you belong to your own mother."</p>

<br>
</small></p>
<p>He is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy, which
towered among us like some ancient ruin, whose frown terrified the
glance its magnificence attracted. Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat
upon the throne, a sceptered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own
originality. A mind, bold, independent, and decisive,--a will despotic
in its dictates--an energy that distanced expedition, and a conscience
pliable to every touch of interest, marked the outline of this
extraordinary character--the most extraordinary, perhaps, that, in the
annals of this world, ever rose, or reigned, or fell.</p>
<p>Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every
energy of a people who acknowledge no superior, he commenced his course,
a stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity! With no friend but his
sword, and no fortune but his talents, he rushed into the lists where
rank and wealth and genius had arrayed themselves, and competition fled
from him as from the glance of destiny. He knew no motive but
interest--he acknowledged no criterion but success--he worshiped no God
but ambition, and, with an Eastern devotion, he knelt at the shrine of
his idolatry.</p>
<p>Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he did not profess,
there was no opinion that he did not promulgate; in the hope of a
dynasty, he upheld the Crescent; for the sake of a divorce, he bowed
before the Cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he became the adopted child
of the Republic; and, with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both
of the throne and tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism.</p>
<p>A professed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot,
he impoverished the country; and, in the name of Brutus, he
grasped--without remorse and wore without shame the diadem of the
Caesars. Through this pantomime of policy, fortune played the clown to
his caprices. At his touch, crowns crumbled, beggars reigned, systems
vanished, the wildest theories took the color of his whim, and all that
was venerable, and all that was novel, changed places with the rapidity
of a drama.</p>
<p>Even apparent defeat assumed the appearance of victory,--his flight
from Egypt confirmed his destiny,--ruin itself only elevated him to
empire. But, if his fortune was great, his genius was transcendent;
decision flashed upon his counsels; and it was the same to decide and to
perform. To inferior intellects his combinations appeared perfectly
impossible, his plans perfectly impracticable; but, in his hands,
simplicity marked their development, and success vindicated their
adoption. His person partook the character of his mind,--if the one
never yielded in the cabinet, the other never bent in the field. Nature
had no obstacle that he did not surmount--space no opposition that he
did not spurn: and whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or Polar
snows, he seemed proof against peril, and empowered with ubiquity.</p>
<p>The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his
designs, and the miracle of their execution. Skepticism bowed to the
prodigies of his performance; romance assumed the air of history; nor
was there aught too incredible for belief, or too fanciful for
expectation, when the world saw a subaltern of Corsica waving his
imperial flag over her most ancient capitals. All the visions of
antiquity became commonplace in his contemplation; kings were his
people--nations were his outposts; and he disposed of courts, and
crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as if they were titular
dignitaries of the chess-board. Amid all these changes, he stood
immutable as adamant.</p>
<p>It mattered little whether in the field or in the drawing-room, with
the mob or the levee--wearing the Jacobin bonnet or the iron
crown--banishing a Braganza, or espousing a Hapsburg--dictating peace on
a raft to the Czar of Russia, or contemplating defeat at the gallows of
Leipsic--he was still the same military despot.</p>
<p>In this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature must
not be omitted. The jailer of the press, he affected the patronage of
letters; the proscriber of books, he encouraged philosophy; the
persecutor of authors and the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to
the protection of learning. Such a medley of contradictions, and at the
same time, such an individual consistency, were never united in the same
character. A royalist--a republican and an emperor--a Mohammedan--a
Catholic and a patron of the synagogue--a subaltern and a sovereign--a
traitor and a tyrant--a Christian and an infidel--he was, through all
his vicissitudes, the same stern, impatient, inflexible original--the
same mysterious, incomprehensible self--a man without a model and
without a shadow.</p>

TRUE GRANDEUR OF NATIONS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>BY CHARLES SUMNER<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>The flowers of gentleness, of kindliness, of fidelity, of humanity,
which flourish in unregarded luxuriance in the rich meadows of peace,
receive unwonted admiration when we discern them in war, like violets
shedding their perfume on the perilous edges of the precipice, beyond
the smiling borders of civilization. God be praised for all the examples
of magnanimous virtue which he has vouchsafed to mankind! God be praised
that the Roman emperor, about to start on a distant expedition of war,
encompassed by squadrons of cavalry and by golden eagles which moved in
the winds, stooped from his saddle to listen to the prayer of the humble
widow, demanding justice for the death of her son! God be praised that
Sidney, on the field of battle, gave with dying hand the cup of cold
water to the dying soldier! That single act of self-forgetful sacrifice
has consecrated the fenny field of Zutphen far, oh, far beyond its
battle; it has consecrated thy name, gallant Sidney, beyond any feat of
thy sword, beyond any triumph of thy pen. But there are hands
out-stretched elsewhere than on fields of blood for so little as a cup
of cold water; the world is full of opportunities for deeds of kindness.
Let me not be told, then, of the virtues of war. Let not the acts of
generosity and sacrifice which have triumphed on its fields be invoked
in its defense. In the words of Oriental imagery, the poisonous tree,
though watered by nectar, can produce only the fruit of death.</p>
<p>As we cast our eyes over the history of nations, we discern with
horror the succession of murderous slaughters by which their progress
has been marked. As the hunter traces the wild beast, when pursued to
his lair, by the drops of blood on the earth, so we follow man, faint,
weary, staggering with wounds, through the black forest of the past,
which he has reddened with his gore. Oh, let it not be in the future
ages as in those which we now contemplate. Let the grandeur of man be
discerned in the blessings which he has secured; in the good he has
accomplished; in the triumphs of benevolence and justice; in the
establishment of perpetual peace.</p>
<p>And peace has its own peculiar victories, in comparison with which
Marathon and Bannockburn and Bunker Hill, fields held sacred in the
history of human freedom, shall lose their lustre. Our own Washington
rises to a truly heavenly stature--not when we follow him over the ice
of the Delaware to the capture of Trenton--not when we behold him
victorious over Cornwallis at Yorktown--but when we regard him, in noble
deference to justice, refusing the kingly crown which a faithless
soldiery proffered, and at a later day upholding the peaceful neutrality
of the country, while he received unmoved the clamor of the people
wickedly crying for war....</p>
<p>To this great work let me summon you. That future which filled the
lofty visions of the sages and bards of Greece and Rome, which was
foretold by the prophets and heralded by the evangelists, when man in
happy isles or in a new paradise shall confess the loveliness of peace,
may be secured by your care, if not for yourselves, at least for your
children. Believe that you can do it, and you can do it. The true golden
age is before you, not behind you.</p>
<p>Let it not be said that the age does not demand this work. The
mighty conquerors of the past from their fiery sepulchres demand it; the
blood of millions unjustly shed in war crying from the ground demands
it; the voices of all good men demand it; the conscience even of the
soldier whispers "peace." There are considerations springing from our
situation and condition which fervently invite us to take the lead in
this great work. To this should bend the patriotic ardor of the land;
the ambition of the statesman; the efforts of the scholar; the pervasive
influence of the press; the mild persuasion of the sanctuary; the early
teachings of the school. Here, in ampler ether and diviner air, are
untried fields for exalted triumphs, more truly worthy the American name
than any snatched from rivers of blood. War is known as the last reason
of kings. Let it be no reason of our republic. Let us renounce and throw
off forever the yoke of a tyranny more oppressive than any in the annals
of the world. As those standing on the mountain tops first discern the
coming beams of morning, let us, from the vantage-ground of liberal
institutions, first recognize the ascending sun of a new era. Lift high,
the gates and let the King of glory in--the King of true glory, of
peace. I catch the last words of music from the lips of innocence and
beauty--</p>
<p>"And let the whole earth be filled with his glory!"</p>
<p>It is a beautiful picture in Grecian story that there was at least
one spot, the small island of Delos, dedicated to the gods, and kept at
all times sacred from war, where the citizens of hostile countries met
and united in a common worship. So let us dedicate our broad country.
The temple of honor shall be surrounded by the temple of concord, so
that the former can be entered only through the portals of the latter;
the horn of abundance shall overflow at its gates; the angel of religion
shall be the guide over its steps of flashing adamant; while within,
Justice, returned to the earth from her long exile in the skies, shall
rear her serene and majestic front. And the future chiefs of the
republic, destined to uphold the glories of a new era, unspotted by
human blood, shall be "the first in peace, and the first in the hearts
of their countrymen."</p>
<p>But while we seek these blissful glories for ourselves, let us
strive to extend them to other lands. Let the bugles sound the truce of
God to the whole world forever. Let the selfish boast of the Spartan
women become the grand chorus of mankind, that they have never seen the
smoke of an enemy's camp. Let the iron belt of martial music which now
encompasses the earth be exchanged for the golden cestus of peace,
clothing all with celestial beauty. And now, on this Sabbath of our
country, let us lay a new stone in the grand temple of universal peace,
whose dome shall be as lofty as the firmament of heaven, as broad and
comprehensive as the earth itself.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The drying up a single tear has more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore."--<i>Byron</i>.</p>
<p><br>
War, pestilence, and famine, by the common consent of mankind, are the
three greatest calamities which can befall our species; and war, as the
most direful, justly, stands foremost and in front. Pestilence and
famine, no doubt for wise although inscrutable purposes, are inflictions
of Providence, to which it is our duty, therefore, to bow with
obedience, humble submission, and resignation. Their duration is not
long, and their ravages are limited. They bring, indeed, great
affliction, while they last, but society soon recovers from their
effects.</p>
<p>War is the voluntary work of our own hands, and whatever reproaches
it may deserve, should be directed to ourselves. When it breaks out, its
duration is indefinite and unknown,--its vicissitudes are hidden from
our view. In the sacrifice of human life, and in the waste of human
treasure,--in its losses and in its burdens,--it affects both
belligerent nations, and its sad effects of mangled bodies, of death,
and of desolation, endure long after its thunders are hushed in peace.</p>
<p>War unhinges society, disturbs its peaceful and regular industry,
and scatters poisonous seeds of disease and immorality, which continue
to germinate and diffuse their baneful influence long after it has
ceased. Dazzling by its glitter, pomp, and pageantry, it begets a spirit
of wild adventure and romantic enterprise, and often disqualifies those
who embark in it, after their return from the bloody fields of battle,
for engaging in the industrious and peaceful vocations of life.</p>
<p>History tells the mournful tale of conquering nations and
conquerors. The three most celebrated conquerors, in the civilized
world, were Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon. The first, after ruining a
large portion of Asia, and sighing and lamenting that there were no more
worlds to subdue, met a premature and ignoble death. His lieutenants
quarreled and warred with each other as to the spoils of his victories,
and finally lost them all.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar, after conquering Gaul, returned with his triumphant
legions to Rome, passed the Rubicon, won the battle of Pharsalia,
trampled upon the liberties of his country, and expired by the patriot
hand of Brutus. But Rome ceased to be free. War and conquest had
enervated and corrupted the masses. The spirit of true liberty was
extinguished, and a long line of emperors succeeded, some of whom were
the most execrable monsters that ever existed in human form.</p>
<p>And Napoleon, that most extraordinary man, perhaps, in all history,
after subjugating all continental Europe, occupying almost all its
capitals,--seriously threatening proud Albion itself,--and decking the
brows of various members of his family with crowns torn from the heads
of other monarchs, lived to behold his own dear France itself in
possession of his enemies, was made himself a wretched captive, and far
removed from country, family, and friends, breathed his last on the
distant and inhospitable rock of St. Helena.</p>
<p>The Alps and the Rhine had been claimed, as the natural boundaries
of France, but even these could not be secured in the treaties, to which
she was reduced to submit. Do you believe that the people of Macedon or
Greece, of Rome, or of France, were benefited, individually or
collectively, by the triumphs of their captains? Their sad lot was
immense sacrifice of life, heavy and intolerable burdens, and the
ultimate loss of liberty itself.</p>

THE POLICY OF A NATION</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>JOHN C. CALHOUN<br>
<br>
</small></p>
<p>I am opposed to war, as a friend to human improvement, to human
civilization, to human progress and advancement. Never, in the history
of the world, has there occurred a period so remarkable. The chemical
and mechanical powers have been investigated and applied to advance the
comforts of human life, in a degree far beyond all that was ever known
before. Civilization has been spreading its influence far and wide, and
the general progress of human society has outstripped all that had been
previously witnessed.</p>
<p>The invention of man has seized upon, and subjugated two great
agencies of the natural world, which never before were made the servants
of man. I refer to steam and to electricity, under which I include
magnetism in all its phenomena. We have been distinguished by Providence
for a great and noble purpose, and I trust we shall fulfill our high
destiny.</p>
<p>Again, I am opposed to war, because I hold that it is now to be
determined whether two such nations as these shall exist for the future,
as friends or enemies. A declaration of war by one of them against the
other, must be pregnant with miseries, not only to themselves, but to
the world.</p>
<p>Another reason is, that mighty means are now put into the hands of
both, to cement and secure a perpetual peace, by breaking down the
barriers of commerce, and uniting them more closely in an intercourse
mutually beneficial. If this shall be accomplished, other nations will,
one after another, follow the fair example, and a state of general
prosperity, heretofore unknown, will gradually unite and bless the
nations of the world.</p>
<p>And far more than all. An intercourse like this points to that
inspiring day which philosophers have hoped for, which poets have seen
in their bright dreams of fancy, and which prophecy has seen in holy
vision,--when men shall learn war no more. Who can contemplate a state
of the world like this, and not feel his heart exult at the prospect?
And who can doubt that, in the hand of an Omnipotent Providence, a free
and unrestricted commerce shall prove one of the greatest agents in
bringing it about?</p>
<p>Finally, I am against war, because peace--peace is pre&euml;minently
our policy. Our great mission, as a people, is to occupy this vast
domain,--there to level forests, and let in upon their solitude the
light of day; to clear the swamps and morasses, and redeem them to the
plow and the sickle; to spread over hill and dale the echoes of human
labor, and human happiness, and contentment; to fill the land with
cities and towns; to unite its opposite extremities by turnpikes and
railroads; to scoop out canals for the transmission of its products, and
open rivers for its internal trade. War can only impede the fulfillment
of this high mission of Heaven; it absorbs the wealth and diverts the
energy which might be so much better devoted to the improvement of our
country. All we want is peace,--established peace; and then time, under
the guidance of a wise and cautious policy, will soon effect for us all
the rest. Where we find that natural causes will of themselves work out
good, our wisdom is to let them work; and all our task is to remove
impediments. In the present case, one of the greatest of these
impediments is found in our impatience.</p>
<p>Yes; time--ever-laboring time--will effect everything for us. Our
population is now increasing at the annual average of six hundred
thousand. Let the next twenty-five years elapse, and our increase will
have reached a million a year, and, at the end of that period, we shall
count a population of forty-five millions. Before that day it will have
spread from ocean to ocean. The coast of the Pacific will then be as
densely populated and as thickly settled with villages and towns as is
now the coast of the Atlantic. If we can preserve peace, who shall set
bounds to our prosperity, or to our success? With one foot planted on
the Atlantic and the other on the Pacific, we shall occupy a position
between the two old continents of the world,--a position eminently
calculated to secure to us the commerce and the influence of both. If we
abide by the counsels of common sense,--if we succeed in preserving our
constitutional liberty, we shall then exhibit a spectacle such, as the
world never saw.</p>
<p>I know that this one great mission is encompassed with difficulties;
but such is the inherent energy of our political system, and such its
expansive capability, that it may be made to govern the widest space. If
by war we become great, we can not be free; if we will be both great and
free, our policy is peace.</p>

millions of the sons of the Pilgrims, till it lose itself in the murmurs
of the Pacific seas.</p>
<p>We would leave for the consideration of those who shall occupy our
places, some proof that we hold the blessings transmitted from our
fathers in just estimation; some proof of our attachment to the cause of
good government, and ardent desire to promote everything which may
enlarge the understandings and improve the hearts of men. And when, from
the long distance of a hundred years, they shall look back upon us, they
shall know, at least, that we possessed affections which, running
backward and warming with gratitude for what our ancestors have done for
our happiness, run forward also to our posterity, and meet them with
cordial salutation, ere yet they have arrived on the shore of being.</p>
<p>Advance, then, ye future generations! We would hail you, as you rise
in your long succession, to fill the places which we now fill, and to
taste the blessings of existence, where we are passing, and soon shall
have passed, our human duration. We bid you welcome to the healthful
skies and the verdant fields of New England. We greet your accession to
the great inheritance which we have enjoyed. We welcome you to the
blessings of good government and religious liberty. We welcome you to
the treasures of science and the delights of learning. We welcome you to
the transcendent sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of kindred,
and parents, and children. We welcome you to the immeasurable blessings
of rational existence, the immortal hope of Christianity, and the light
of everlasting truth!</p>

Webster stands out as America's foremost orator. His eloquence,
enhanced by the force of his personality, was equally great whether
answering an opponent in the Senate, pleading a case as a lawyer, or in
the more dispassionate orations of anniversary occasions. He was the
champion of the national idea and of complete union, and therefore
bitterly opposed Hayne and Calhoun. He supported Clay in the compromise
measures of 1850. His supremacy in American statesmanship, as senator,
and as secretary of state, makes him "the notablest of our
notabilities." These are the closing paragraphs from his oration
delivered at Plymouth, December 22, 1820, on the two hundredth
anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims.</p>

SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>DANIEL WEBSTER</small></p>
<p><br>
Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my
heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in the beginning we aimed
not at independence. But there is a divinity which shapes our ends. The
injustice of England has driven us to arms; and, blinded to her own
interest, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now within
our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why, then,
should we defer the declaration? If we postpone independence, do we mean
to carry on or to give up the war? Do we mean to submit, and consent
that we shall be ground to powder, and our country and its rights
trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to submit. We never
shall submit!</p>
<p>The war, then, must go on; we must fight it through. And if the war
must go on, why put off the declaration of independence? That measure
will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. Nations will then
treat with us, which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves
subjects in arms against our sovereign.</p>
<p>If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The
cause will raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The
people--the people, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will
carry themselves, gloriously through this struggle. I care not how
fickle other people have been found. I know the people of these
colonies; and I know that resistance to British aggression is deep and
settled in their hearts, and cannot be eradicated. Sir, the declaration
of independence will inspire the people with increased courage. Instead
of a long and bloody war for the restoration of privileges, for redress
of grievances, set before them the glorious object of entire
independence, and it will breathe into them anew the spirit of life.</p>
<p>Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword will be
drawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it or perish on the bed of
honor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the
love of religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with
it, or fall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let
them see it, who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of
Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very
walls will cry out in its support.</p>
<p>O Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see
clearly through this day's business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We
may not live to see the time this declaration shall be made good. We may
die; die colonists; die slaves; die, it may be ignominiously, and on the
scaffold. Be it so: be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my
country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be
ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But
while I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a
country, and that a free country.</p>
<p>But whatever may be our fate, be assured--be assured that this
declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but
it will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick
gloom of the present I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in
heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in
our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with
thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its
annual return they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears; not of
subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of
gratitude, and of joy.</p>
<p>Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves
the measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that
I am, and all that I hope in this life, I am now ready here to stake
upon it; and I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or
perish, I am for the declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the
blessing of God, it shall be my dying sentiment; independence now, and
independence forever.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span>&nbsp;Boston was
deeply moved, on July 4, 1826, by the news of the death of John Adams,
just fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
He was not only conscious of the significance of the day, but had spoken
of his colleague, Thomas Jefferson, and the fact that Jefferson would
survive him. A few days later, news came from Virginia that Jefferson
had died on the same day, a few hours earlier than Adams. The whole
country was deeply affected by this remarkable coincidence. On the
second of August a public memorial meeting was held in Faneuil Hall,
Boston, at which Daniel Webster delivered an oration on "Adams and
Jefferson." In this speech, merely a part of the oration, Webster
represents what Adams might have said at the time of the Declaration of
Independence.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SOUTH_CAROLINA_AND_THE_UNION"></a>SOUTH
CAROLINA AND THE UNION</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ROBERT HAYNE</small></p>
<p><br>
I shall make no profession of zeal for the interests and honor of South
Carolina. If there be one state in the Union that may challenge
comparison with any other, for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and
uncalculating devotion to the Union, that state is South Carolina. From
the very commencement of the Revolution up to this hour, there is no
sacrifice, however great, she has not cheerfully made, no service she
has ever hesitated to perform. She has adhered to you in your
prosperity; but in your adversity she has clung to you with more than
filial affection. No matter what was the condition of her domestic
affairs, though deprived of her resources, divided by parties, or
surrounded with difficulties, the call of the country has been to her as
the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at the sound; every man became
at once reconciled to his brethren, and the sons of Carolina were all
seen crowding together to the temple, bringing gifts to the altar of
their common country.</p>
<p>What was the conduct of the South during the Revolution? I honor New
England for her conduct in that glorious struggle. But great as is the
praise which belongs to her, I think at least equal honor is due the
South. They espoused the quarrel of their brethren with a generous zeal
which did not suffer them to stop to calculate their interest in the
dispute. Favorites of the mother country, possessed of neither ships nor
seamen to create a commercial rivalship, they might have found in their
situation a guaranty that their trade would be forever fostered and
protected by Great Britain. But, trampling on all considerations either
of interest or of safety, they rushed into the conflict, and, fighting
for principle, periled all in the sacred cause of freedom. Never were
there exhibited in the history of the world higher examples of noble
daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic endurance than by the Whigs of
Carolina during the Revolution. The whole state, from the mountains to
the sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy. The fruits
of industry perished on the spot where they were produced, or were
consumed by the foe.</p>
<p>The "plains of Carolina" drank up the most precious blood of her
citizens. Black and smoking ruins marked the places which had been the
habitations of her children. Driven from their homes into the gloomy and
almost impenetrable swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived,
and South Carolina, sustained by the example of her Sumters and her
Marions, proved, by her conduct, that, though her soil might be overrun,
the spirit of her people was invincible.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> In January of
1830, Senator Foote of Connecticut introduced into the Senate a
resolution regarding the sale of public lands. The subject of state
rights being uppermost in their minds, the debaters wandered off into a
discussion of the Constitution. Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South
Carolina, in a brilliant speech set forth the doctrine of nullification,
and Daniel Webster answered him in one of the greatest speeches ever
delivered. This extract and the following are taken from this memorable
debate, when for the first time the two opposing theories of the
Constitution, the "state" and he "national," were clearly set forth.</p>

<p><br>
I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes before me in
regard for whatever of distinguished talent or distinguished character
South Carolina has produced. I claim part of the honor, I partake in the
pride, of her great name. I claim them for countrymen, one and all. The
Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumters, the
Marions--Americans all--whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by state
lines than their talents and patriotism were capable of being
circumscribed within the same narrow limits. In their day and
generation, they served and honored the country, and the whole country;
and their renown is of the treasures of the whole country.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I shall enter upon no encomium upon Massachusetts;
she needs none. There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves.
There is her history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least,
is secure. There is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill;
and there they will remain forever. The bones of her sons, fallen in the
great struggle for independence, now lie mingled with the soil of every
state from New England to Georgia; and there they will lie forever. And,
sir, where American liberty raised its first voice, and where its youth
was nurtured and sustained, there it still lives, in the strength of its
manhood, and full of its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall
wound it; if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk and tear it; if
folly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary and necessary restraint,
shall succeed in separating it from that Union by which alone its
existence is made sure,--it will stand, in the end, by the side of that
cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth its arm,
with whatever vigor it may still retain, over the friends who gather
round it; and it will fall at last, if fall it must, amidst the proudest
monuments of its own glory and on the very spot of its origin.</p>
<p>I cannot persuade myself to relinquish this subject without
expressing my deep conviction, that, since it respects nothing less than
THE UNION OF THE STATES, it is of most vital and essential importance to
the public happiness. I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have
kept steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole country and
the preservation of our federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our
safety at home and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that
Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of
our country.</p>
<p>That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues in the
severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of
disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit, Under its
benign influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the
dead, and sprang forth with newness of life.</p>
<p>Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its
utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has stretched out
wider and wider, and our population spread farther and farther, they
have not outrun its protection or its benefits. It has been to us a
copious fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.</p>
<p>I have not allowed myself to look beyond the Union, to see what
might lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed
the chances of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together
shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the
precipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom
the depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor
in the affairs of this government, whose thoughts should be mainly bent
on considering, not how the Union should be best preserved, but how
tolerable might be the condition of the people when it shall be broken
up and destroyed.</p>
<p>While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects
spread out before us, for us and our children. Beyond that, I seek not
to penetrate the veil. God grant that, in my day, at least, that curtain
may not rise,--that on my vision never may be opened what lies behind.</p>
<p>When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun
in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
fragments of a once glorious Union--on States dissevered discordant,
belligerent,--on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be,
in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather
behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known and honored
throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its arms and trophies
streaming in their original luster, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor
a single star obscured, bearing for its motto, no such miserable
interrogatory as, "What is all this worth?" nor those other words of
delusion and folly, "Liberty first and Union afterward"; but everywhere,
spread all over in characters of living light, blazing on all its ample
folds, as they float over the sea and over the land, and in every wind
under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to every true
American heart,--LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE!</p>

SPEECH AT GETTYSBURG.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</small></p>
<p><br>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
great civil war; testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of
that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not
consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to
be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Historical:</span> At the dedication

Walt Whitman will always be remembered as the author of this poem. It
differs from his other poems in that it shows a great deal of attention
to form, to metre, and rhyme. He wrote not so much with the aim to
please as to arouse and uplift. He was very democratic in his taste, and
loved to mingle with the crowds on the ferries and omnibuses. At
different times he was school teacher, carpenter, and journalist. This
poem was written in appreciation of Lincoln, at the time of his death.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="EXTRACTS_FROM_WASHINGTONS_FAREWELL"></a>EXTRACTS FROM
WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE</p>
<p><br>
Friends and Fellow-Citizens,</p>
<p>The period for a new election of a Citizen, to administer the
Executive Government of the United States, being not far distant, and
the time actually arrived, when your thoughts must be employed in
designating the person, who is to be clothed with that important trust,
it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct
expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the
resolution I have formed, to decline being considered among the number
of those, out of whom a choice is to be made....</p>
<p>The unity of government, which constitutes you one people, is also
now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice
of your real independence,--the support of your tranquillity at home and
your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very
liberty which you so highly prize.</p>
<p>But as it is easy to foresee that, from different causes and from
different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed,
to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the
point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal
and external enemies will be most constantly and actively, though often
covertly and insidiously, directed,--it is of infinite moment that you
should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to
your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a
cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourself
to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety
and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety;
discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can, in
any event, be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning
of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest,
or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.</p>
<p>To the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the
whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts
can be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the
infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have
experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved your
essay, by the adoption of the constitution of a government better
calculated than your former for an intimate union, and for the
efficacious management of your common concerns.</p>
<p>This government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and
unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation,
completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers,
uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision
for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your
support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws,
acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental
maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right
of the people to make and to alter their constitution of government; but
the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit
and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.
The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish
government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the
established government.</p>
<p>All obstructions to the executions of the laws, all combinations and
associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design
to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and
action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this
fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize
faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in
the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party,
often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community;
and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make
the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and
incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and
wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual
interests.</p>
<p>However combinations or associations of the above description may
now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time
and things, to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and
unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and
to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying afterward
the very engines which had lifted them to unjust dominion.</p>
<p>Toward the preservation of your government and the permanency of
your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily
discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but
also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its
principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be
to effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will
impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be
directly overthrown.</p>
<p>In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time
and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of
governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the
surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing
constitution of a country; that facility in changes, upon the credit of
mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the
endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that
for the efficient management of your common interest in a country so
extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with
the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will
find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and
adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name
where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of
faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits
prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil
enjoyment of the rights of person and property.</p>
<p>It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free
country should inspire caution, in those intrusted with its
administration, to confine themselves within their respective
constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one
department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to
consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to
create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just
estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it, which
predominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the
truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the
exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into
different depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the public
weal against invasion by the others, has been evinced by experiments
ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes.
To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them.</p>
<p>If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification
of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be
corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates.
But let there be no change by usurpation; for, though this, in one
instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by
which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly
overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit, which
the use can at any time yield.</p>
<p>Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political
prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain
would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to
subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of
the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the
pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not
trace all their connections with private and public felicity.</p>
<p>Let it simply be asked, where is the security for property, for
reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the
oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice?
And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be
maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence
of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and
experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail
in exclusion of religious principle.</p>
<p>It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary
spring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or
less force to every species of free government. Who, that is a sincere
friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the
foundation of the fabric?</p>
<p>Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for
the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a
government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public
opinion should be enlightened.</p>
<p>In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and
affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and
lasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual
current of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course,
which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But, if I may even
flatter myself, that they may be productive of some partial benefit,
some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the
fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue,
to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this hope will
be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they
have been dictated.</p>
<p>How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided
by the principles which have been delineated, the public records and
other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To
myself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have at least
believed myself to be guided by them.</p>
<p>Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am
unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my
defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.
Whatever they may be I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or
mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me
the hope, that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence;
and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service
with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be
consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.</p>
<p>Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by
that fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man, who views in
it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several
generations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in
which I promise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of
partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of
good laws under a free government, the ever favorite object of my heart,
and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and
dangers.</p>

MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>HENRY WARD BEECHER</small></p>
<p><br>
We are called upon to cherish with high veneration and grateful
recollections the memory of our fathers. Both the ties of nature and the
dictates of policy demand this. And surely no nation had ever less
occasion to be ashamed of its ancestry, or more occasion for
gratification in that respect; for, while most nations trace their
origin to barbarians, the foundations of our nation were laid by
civilized men, by Christians. Many of them were men of distinguished
families, of powerful talents, of great learning and of preeminent
wisdom, of decision of character, and of most inflexible integrity. And
yet not unfrequently they have been treated as if they had no virtues;
while their sins and follies have been sedulously immortalized in
satirical anecdote.</p>
<p>The influence of such treatment of our fathers is too manifest. It
creates and lets loose upon their institutions the vandal spirit of
innovation and overthrow; for, after the memory of our fathers shall
have been rendered contemptible, who will uphold and sustain their
institutions? The memory of our fathers should be the watch-word of
liberty throughout the land; for, imperfect as they were, the world
before had not seen their like, nor will it soon, we fear, behold their
like again. Such models of moral excellence, such apostles of civil and
religious liberty, such shades of the illustrious dead looking down upon
their descendants with approbation or reproof, according as they follow
or depart from the good way, constitute a censorship inferior only to
the eye of God; and to ridicule them is a national suicide.</p>
<p>The doctrines of our fathers have been represented as gloomy,
superstitious, severe, irrational, and of a licentious tendency. But
when other systems shall have produced a piety as devoted, a morality as
pure, a patriotism as disinterested, and a state of society as happy, as
have prevailed where their doctrines have been most prevalent, it may be
in season to seek an answer to this objection.</p>
<p>The persecutions instituted by our fathers have been the occasion of
ceaseless obloquy upon their fame. And, truly, it was a fault of no
ordinary magnitude, that sometimes they did persecute. But let him whose
ancestors were not ten times more guilty cast the first stone, and the
ashes of our fathers will no more be disturbed. Theirs was the fault of
the age, and it will be easy to show that no class of men had, at that
time, approximated so nearly to just apprehensions of religious liberty;
and that it is to them that the world is now indebted for the more just
and definite views which now prevail.</p>
<p>The superstition and bigotry of our fathers are themes on which some
of their descendants, themselves far enough from superstition, if not
from bigotry, have delighted to dwell. But when we look abroad and
behold the condition of the world, compared with the condition of New
England, we may justly exclaim, "Would to God that the ancestors of all
the nations had been not only almost, but altogether such bigots as our
fathers were."</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Biographical and Historical:</span> The
name of Joseph Rodman Drake is inseparably associated with that of his
friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck. Together they contributed a series of forty
poems to the New York Evening Post. Among these was "The American Flag,"
the last four lines of which were written by Halleck, to replace those
written by Drake:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As fixed as
yonder orb divine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That saw thy bannered blaze unfurled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall thy proud stars resplendent shine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard and glory of the world."</p>
<p>Drake was a youth of many graces of both mind and body, who wrote
verses as a bird sings--for the pure joy of it. His career was cut short
by death when he was only twenty-five years old. Of him Halleck wrote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None knew thee
but to love thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor named thee but to praise."</p>

Rudyard Kipling was born Christmas Week, 1865, in Bombay. After school
life in England, he returned to India at the age of seventeen, to do
journalistic work. His tales of Indian. life and his ballads describing
the life of the British soldier won immediate favor. Perhaps he is best
known to the boys and girls as the author of the Jungle Books. From 1892
to 1896 he lived in the United States. This poem, which appeared in

DEFINITION OF A GENTLEMAN</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>CARDINAL NEWMAN</small></p>
<p><br>
It is almost a definition of a gentleman to say he is one who never
inflicts pain. This description is both refined and, as far as it goes,
accurate. He is mainly occupied in merely removing the obstacles which
hinder the free and unembarrassed action of those about him; and he
concurs with their movements rather than takes the initiative himself.
His benefits may be considered as parallel to what are called comforts
or conveniences in arrangements of a personal nature: like an easy-chair
or a good fire, which do their part in dispelling cold and fatigue,
though nature provides both means of rest and animal heat without them.
The true gentleman in like manner carefully avoids whatever may cause a
jar or a jolt in the minds of those with whom he is cast;--all clashing
of opinion, or collision of feeling, all restraint, or suspicion, or
gloom, or resentment; his great concern being to make every one at their
ease and at home. He has his eyes on all his company; he is tender
toward the bashful, gentle toward the distant, and merciful toward the
absurd; he can recollect to whom he is speaking; he guards against
unseasonable allusions, or topics which may irritate; he is seldom
prominent in conversation, and never wearisome. He makes light of favors
while he does them, and seems to be receiving when he is conferring. He
never speaks of himself except when compelled, never defends himself by
a mere retort; he has no ears for slander or gossip, is scrupulous in
imputing motives to those who interfere with him, and interprets
everything for the best. He is never mean or little in his disputes,
never takes unfair advantage, never mistakes personalities or sharp
sayings for arguments, or insinuates evil which he dare not say out.
From a long-sighted prudence, he observes the maxim of the ancient sage,
that we should ever conduct ourselves toward our enemy as if he were one
day to be our friend. He has too much good sense to be affronted at
insults; he is too well employed to remember injuries, and too indolent
to bear malice. He is patient, forbearing, and resigned, on
philosophical principles; he submits to pain because it is inevitable,
to bereavement because it is irreparable, and to death because it is his
destiny. If he engages in controversy of any kind, his disciplined
intellect preserves him from the blundering discourtesy of better,
perhaps, but less educated minds; who, like blunt weapons, tear and hack
instead of cutting clean, who mistake the point in argument, waste their
strength on trifles, misconceive their adversary, and leave the question
more involved than they find it. He may be right or wrong in his
opinion, but he is too clear-headed to be unjust; he is as simple as he
is forcible, and as brief as he is decisive. Nowhere shall we find
greater candor, consideration, indulgence: he throws himself into the
minds of his opponents, he accounts for their mistakes. He knows the
weakness of human reason as well as its strength, its province, and its
limits.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
